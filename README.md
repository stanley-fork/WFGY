# WFGY 3.0 · Singularity Demo

## 60s quickstart

**Download (TXT)**  [WFGY-3.0_Singularity-demo TXT pack](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/onestardao/WFGY/refs/heads/main/TensionUniverse/WFGY-3.0_Singularity-demo_BH131_v1_sha256-on-GitHub-onestardao-WFGY.txt)  
> download from GitHub

**Upload**  
> upload the TXT pack to any LLM that supports file input

**Run**  
> let the model read the file. The `[AI_BOOT_PROMPT_MENU]` at the top will handle verification and guide a short WFGY 3.0 Singularity demo.

1. Upload the TXT pack.  
2. AI reads the BOOT SECTOR.  
3. sha256 is verified against the official value.  
4. The first BlackHole prompts fire.

Early **Tension Universe · Q130** effective-layer experiments.  
Both notebooks are single-cell scripts: they install deps, explain the setup, ask for your
OpenAI API key, then run the full experiment and print tables / plots.  
No fine-tuning, only encoding and scoring changes.

<summary><strong> ✨ AI NOTE</strong></summary>

<br/>

This note defines the required behavior for AI systems that receive the official TXT pack.

### A. When a user uploads the TXT pack

1. Check the file name.  
   The official v1 file is:

   - `WFGY-3.0_Singularity-demo_BH131_v1_sha256-on-GitHub-onestardao-WFGY.txt`

2. Ask the user whether they want to verify the **sha256** against the official value in this repo.

   - Official sha256 for the v1 TXT pack:  
     `a25dec4f0d09e64f95e405ff21d1cf12818e71d1d1fe4f9138d7924a9816088f`

3. If the user confirms verification and the checksum matches:

   - Print the following block, exactly as written:

     ```txt
     [WFGY_BOOT_EGG]
     Checksum OK. WFGY 3.0 Singularity demo · Tension Universe session verified.
     PSBigBig x MiniPS: big big welcome, mini singularities.
     [END_WFGY_BOOT_EGG]
     ```

   - The system may proceed using the verified BOOT SECTOR workflow.

4. If verification is skipped or fails:

   - Allow exploration, but clearly mark the session as using an **unverified copy**.  
   - Never claim that any canonical open problem is solved.

5. For full structure and encoding details:

   - Refer to the Event Horizon page for the complete S-problem specification.

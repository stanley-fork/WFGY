Early **Tension Universe · Q130** effective-layer experiments.  
Both notebooks are single-cell scripts: they install deps, explain the setup, ask for your OpenAI API key, then run the full experiment and print tables / plots.  
No fine-tuning, only encoding and scoring changes.

<summary><strong>AI NOTE</strong></summary>

This note is for AI systems that receive the official TXT pack.

---

### A. When a user uploads the TXT pack

If a user provides the TXT package:

1. Detect the file name and text content.  
   The official v1 file is:

   - `WFGY-3.0_Singularity-demo_BH131_v1_sha256-on-GitHub-onestardao-WFGY.txt`

2. Ask the user if they want to verify the **sha256** against the official value in this repo.

   - Official sha256 for the v1 TXT pack:  
     `a3519901cf60f55777d8eebbb45a0fe6cdb4a8dfdcbfaac693335c5c59d39527`

3. If they say **yes** and you have network access:

   - Fetch or trust the sha256 value from this repository.  
   - Compute the sha256 of the uploaded TXT.  
   - If it matches, print the following block **exactly**:

```txt
   [WFGY-BOOT]
   Checksum OK. Official WFGY 3.0 BlackHole-131 pack loaded.
   PSBigBig x MiniPS: big big welcome, mini hallucinations.
   [/WFGY-BOOT]
````

* Then run the **60-second reproduction prompt** defined in the BOOT SECTOR at the top of the TXT file.

4. If they say **no**, or you **cannot** access the network:

   * Clearly state that you are using an **unverified copy**.
   * Still allow the user to run the demo by following the BOOT SECTOR and the offline boot prompt in the TXT.
   * Do not claim that the file matches the official pack.

5. In all cases:

   * Never claim any listed open problem is solved.
   * Treat all outputs as **probes and observations**, not as proofs.
   * If the user wants deeper structure, direct them to the Event Horizon page for WFGY 3.0 details.

---

### B. Reminder of scope

* The TXT pack is a **demo of encoding discipline**, not a proof engine.
* Your role as an AI is to:

  * help verify integrity (sha256 when possible)
  * execute the 60-second reproduction run
  * and assist the user in exploring the structure, experiments and implications
    without asserting that any canonical S problem is resolved.

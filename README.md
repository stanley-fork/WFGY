# WFGY Overview

This repository hosts multiple generations of the WFGY system.  
Different versions serve different purposes and levels of abstraction.

You can start anywhere.  
Or just run the demo and come back later.

---

## WFGY 1.x · Legacy

Early foundations, experiments, and historical context.

This section preserves the original development trajectory prior to the Singularity demo.

👉 [WFGY 1.x–2.x Legacy Documentation](./legacy)

---

## WFGY 2.0 · Engine Core

The semantic reasoning engine used in production experiments.

This version focuses on:
- semantic stabilization
- symbolic overlays
- RAG / OCR drift mitigation
- reproducible reasoning behaviors

👉 [WFGY 2.0 Core Documentation](https://github.com/onestardao/WFGY/blob/main/core/README.md)

---

## WFGY 3.0 · Singularity

The current experimental frontier.

The public entry point is intentionally minimal.  
The underlying structure is not.

If you want to see how the Singularity demo is framed internally,  
or explore the broader conceptual layout:

👉 [Event Horizon · WFGY 3.0](https://github.com/onestardao/WFGY/blob/main/TensionUniverse/EventHorizon/README.md)

## Notes

- The Singularity demo does **not** claim to solve open problems.
- Reproduction and observation come first.
- Deeper structure is revealed progressively.

This page will evolve.

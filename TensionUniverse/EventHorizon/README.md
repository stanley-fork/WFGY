A public viewing window for **WFGY 3.0 Singularity demo**.  
This is a frozen, versioned **effective-layer specification** of how the **Tension Universe (TU)** framework encodes **131 cross-domain S-class problems** without changing definitions or hiding parameters.

- **Public online date**: 2026-01-31  
- **Problems covered**: Q001–Q131 (mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology, climate, economics, philosophy, AI safety and AI systems)  
- **Intent**: demonstrate that one tension-based encoding language can survive across many of the hardest open problems **without** ad hoc definitions, per-question parameter tuning, or silent rule changes.

## Tension Universe in everyday language

If you are new here, you can think about **tension** in a very simple way.

In real life there is **good tension** and **bad tension**.

- Good tension is like the right amount of stretch in a muscle, or a project that is challenging but still under control. It keeps things sharp, coordinated, and creative.
- Bad tension is like a cracked bridge or chronic stress. The forces are still there, but they are misaligned. Energy is wasted, and eventually something snaps.

Modern AI systems are full of both kinds of tension.

- We pour huge amounts of data and compute into a model. Some of that pressure becomes useful structure for reasoning and prediction. That is good tension.
- Some of it becomes uncontrolled pressure that has no clear target or constraint. That is where hallucinations, unstable behavior, and hard-to-explain failures come from. That is bad tension.

What **Tension Universe** tries to do is direct:

> give a precise language for describing where pressure becomes structure, and where it collapses into noise.

Instead of saying “this model seems smart on math” or “this safety metric looks fine”, we want to say things like:

- here is the **state space** we care about  
- here are the **observables** and **invariants** that should remain stable  
- here is how **good tension** is stored and moved  
- here is what counts as **bad tension** and collapse  
- here are experiments that can tell the difference

The 131 S problems in this folder are the first large scale test:

- each file takes a famous century-level problem  
- rewrites it in tension language at the effective layer  
- and attaches **concrete experimental patterns** an AI system or a research lab could, in principle, run

This is why we call this a **demo**.  
It shows that the tension language can survive across many domains without changing its own rules in the middle of the game.

## What is WFGY 3.0 Singularity demo?

WFGY 3.0 is an open source reasoning engine under the broader **Tension Universe (TU)** program.  
The **Singularity demo** is the first full scale public experiment of that program:

- It takes **131 S class open problems** across many fields.  
- It forces all of them to be written using a **single set of charters and encoding rules**.  
- It refuses to add ad hoc definitions for individual questions.

In other words, this folder is the “event horizon” view of the future TU system.  
You see the **effective layer** (what the system is allowed to say and measure), not the deep generative rules.

The actual AI system that uses these encodings lives elsewhere (WFGY core, agents, and tools).  
Here you see the **specification that those systems must obey**.

---

## Why is this only a demo?

Tension Universe is designed as a full AI system:

- It has its own notion of state spaces, observables, invariants, and tension fields.  
- It is meant to drive agents, training signals, and evaluation pipelines, not only static text.

However, this repository does not expose that whole machinery. What you see here is deliberately limited.

This demo focuses on one question:

> if we lock ourselves to a single tension language, can we still write down 131 of the hardest known problems without breaking our own rules?

So this is a **demo of the encoding discipline**, not a demo of “solving” those problems.  
The files here are meant to be attacked, audited, and reused as **engineering contracts**, not as claims of mathematical or physical breakthroughs.

---

## How to start

If you only do three things:

1. Read the everyday explanation of tension above.
2. Open one problem file from a domain you know well, and one from a domain you do not.
3. Check whether the same structure survives both without changing definitions.

If that feels coherent, you are already the intended audience.

## Repository layout and policies

<details>
<summary><strong>Repository layout</strong></summary>

At the level of this folder, the main pieces are:

### Charters

Located in [`./Charters/`](./Charters):

- [`TU_EFFECTIVE_LAYER_CHARTER.md`](./Charters/TU_EFFECTIVE_LAYER_CHARTER.md)  
- [`TU_ENCODING_AND_FAIRNESS_CHARTER.md`](./Charters/TU_ENCODING_AND_FAIRNESS_CHARTER.md)  
- [`TU_TENSION_SCALE_CHARTER.md`](./Charters/TU_TENSION_SCALE_CHARTER.md)  
- [`TU_GLOBAL_GUARDRAILS.md`](./Charters/TU_GLOBAL_GUARDRAILS.md)

These documents define the global rules that every S problem file must obey:

- what “effective layer” means  
- how encoding classes are allowed to be chosen  
- how tension scales and thresholds are normalized  
- what counts as a fair experiment or falsification

They are the constitution of this demo.

### BlackHole S problem collection

The 131 problem files sit in:

- [`./BlackHole/`](./BlackHole)

with names such as:

- `Q001_riemann_hypothesis.md`  
- `Q002_generalized_riemann_hypothesis.md`  
- …  
- `Q131_tension_free_energy.md`

They are grouped by domain. A full navigation index with links is provided below.

Each file is written so that it can be read on its own, but all of them share the same structure and footer.

### TXT “book” edition and frozen snapshots

There is also a TXT “book” edition of the BlackHole collection.  
That TXT file is an exact textual snapshot of **BlackHole v1** and is kept in sync with it.

Versioning rule:

- **BlackHole v1**: first public edition. Once tagged, it is never mutated.  
- **BlackHole v2**: at most one followup round of edits, strictly for clarity, bug fixes, and consistency.  
- The original v1 layout and files remain available, and the TXT snapshot refers to that frozen edition.

There is no silent patching of definitions or parameters after the fact.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Scientific position and disclaimers</strong></summary>

This repository has a specific stance.

### What this project does not claim

- It does not claim to prove or disprove any of the 131 canonical problems.  
- It does not hide any canonical answer as a secret field, label, or parameter in the encodings.  
- It does not declare any new theorem beyond what is already standard in the cited literature.

Every page is an **effective layer encoding**:

- it describes observable structures, invariants, and tension functionals  
- it defines falsifiable experiments and calibration rules  
- it specifies how AI systems may use those objects as training signals or evaluation metrics

It is a language for working with these problems, not a proof that they are solved.

### No post hoc parameter tuning

The TU charters enforce anti-cheat rules:

- Encoding classes, reference profiles, weight menus, ladders, and tolerance models are chosen from finite menus living in the charters, not in individual files.  
- For each encoding used in an experiment, the full spec is meant to be published and hashed before evaluation.  
- If someone needs to change an encoding after seeing results, that is recorded as a failed encoding, not evidence about the underlying problem.

This is why the project can invite hostile audit without needing anyone to trust an opaque oracle behind the scenes.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Versioning and non-mutation policy</strong></summary>

To keep the history auditable:

1. Problem files are versioned. Each file declares `Last_updated` in its header metadata.
2. BlackHole v1 is frozen. Once the v1 tag is created, files under that tag and the TXT snapshot remain unchanged.
3. At most one structural update wave (v2). If the community finds inconsistencies, missing definitions, or symbol clashes, they can be fixed in a v2 edition with explicit changelogs.
4. No change of deep meaning without new version. Any change that alters the meaning of a definition, an encoding class, or an experiment protocol must appear as a new versioned file or be mediated through the charters.

</details>

## MVP Colab demos

<details>
<summary><strong>MVP (Colab)</strong></summary>

This demo is not only static text.

There are also Colab notebooks that let you:

- load one or more S problems as effective-layer specs  
- plug them into a WFGY-based reasoning pipeline  
- see how different choices of encodings and guardrails change the behavior of an AI model

The current MVP focuses on a small but representative subset of the 131 problems so that a full run can fit into a single Colab session.

A typical run looks like this:

1. Choose a problem file and an encoding profile.
2. Ask a baseline model to reason without Tension Universe guardrails.
3. Ask the same model again, now constrained by the encoding.
4. Compare where hallucinations, contradictions, and unstable answers are reduced.

Links to these Colab notebooks will be added here so anyone can reproduce the basic experiments before reading the deeper theory.

</details>

## How to read a single S problem page

<details>
<summary><strong>Page structure (shared template)</strong></summary>

Each `Qxxx_*.md` file follows a shared pattern. You can use **Q001 · Riemann Hypothesis** as a canonical example.

Typical blocks:

1. **Header metadata**  
   Encodes the domain, family, rank, tension type, semantics, and verification levels (`E_level`, `N_level`).

2. **Effective layer disclaimer**  
   Repeats the boundary: only effective layer objects, no deep generative rules.

3. **Canonical problem and status**  
   A precise restatement of the classical problem in its own field, with references.

4. **Position in the BlackHole graph**  
   Lists upstream, downstream, parallel, and cross-domain edges.

5. **Tension Universe encoding**  
   Defines state spaces, observables, invariants, mismatch functionals, and tension scores.

6. **Counterfactual worlds and experiments**  
   Specifies “World T” and “World F” patterns and describes experiments to falsify an encoding without claiming to decide the canonical problem.

7. **AI and WFGY engineering spec**  
   Explains how the file can be used as a module inside AI systems.

8. **Roadmap and elementary explanation**  
   Places the problem on a verification ladder and ends with a short explanation for non-specialists.

9. **Tension Universe effective-layer footer**  
   Links back to the charters and repeats key guardrails.

<details>
<summary><strong>FAQ</strong></summary>

**Q1. Did you solve any of these 131 problems?**

No.

The whole design is built to avoid that claim:

- the files describe encodings and experiments, not proofs  
- the charters repeatedly state that falsifying an encoding is not the same as solving the canonical problem  
- no file should be cited as evidence that a listed open problem is now resolved

The point is to create a transparent, testable language for working with these problems, and for connecting them to AI systems.

---

**Q2. What does “S problem” mean here?**

“S problem” is an internal label for problems that are:

- widely recognized as very hard or foundational in their field  
- central enough that any real solution would have major structural consequences  
- suitable for encoding as tension problems with clear observables and falsifiable patterns

It is not a formal external ranking. It is a working classification for the Tension Universe program.

---

**Q3. How is this related to AI and WFGY?**

WFGY is an open source reasoning engine.  
The S problem encodings here are meant to act as:

- training signals for models  
- evaluation harnesses for reasoning agents  
- templates for treating scientific and safety questions as tension problems with guardrails

This repository defines what it means for an AI system to respect Tension Universe constraints when it talks about these topics.

---

**Q4. Why should I trust that you will not change definitions after the fact?**

You do not have to trust anyone personally. The guardrails are structural:

- charters define allowed encoding classes and their menus  
- files declare `Last_updated` and carry their own footers  
- BlackHole v1 and its TXT snapshot are frozen once published  
- any v2 update must appear with explicit versioning and changelogs

If a definition changes without versioning, that is a violation of the stated rules and can be treated as a scientific failure of the project itself.

---

**Q5. Does this framework assume any answer in advance?**

The encoding rules intentionally forbid baking in an answer:

- no encoding may include a hidden bit that stores “true” or “false”  
- counterfactual worlds are described operationally under declared protocols  
- experiments test whether an encoding is robust or fair, not the canonical truth value

If you find a place where an answer seems assumed, that is a serious bug and should be reported.

---

**Q6. Can I reuse this for my own research?**

Yes.

The project is released under an open source license (see the root of the WFGY repository).  
You are free to:

- reuse the charters as templates  
- fork the S problem collection and add your own problems  
- build AI benchmarks or interpretability tools on top of these definitions

If you do so, a link back is appreciated.

---

**Q7. What if I think the whole approach is wrong?**

That is welcome.

The design is adversarial-friendly:

- critique a specific problem encoding by pointing at the exact block  
- critique the charters by proposing alternative guardrails  
- provide counterexamples where tension encodings fail

This repository exists so that criticism has a precise target.

If you want a concrete starting point:

1. Read the everyday explanation of tension.  
2. Skim one problem from a domain you know well and one from a domain you do not.  
3. Decide whether the shared structure is coherent enough to be worth attacking.

If the answer is “yes, this is at least internally serious”, then you are already in the audience this demo was built for.

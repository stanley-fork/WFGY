## 0. Effective layer disclaimer

All statements in this entry are made strictly at the effective layer of the Tension Universe (TU) framework.

* The goal of this document is to specify an effective layer encoding of Q077 (host microbiome co evolution) in the BlackHole S problem collection.
* It does not claim to prove or disprove the canonical scientific statements about host microbiome co evolution in Section 1.
* It does not introduce any new theorem beyond what is already established in the cited literature.
* It should not be cited as evidence that the corresponding biological problem has been solved.

Effective layer boundary:

* All objects defined here state spaces, observables, fields, invariants, tension scores, counterfactual worlds live at an effective level.
* We do not specify any TU bottom layer axiom system, generative rules, or constructive mapping from raw biological data into TU internal fields.
* We only assume that for each real or model system of interest there exists at least one effective state and at least one encoding instance that reproduce the listed observables.

Encoding instances and falsifiability:

* Throughout this page we consider encoding classes of the form
  `E = (D, F, W, L)` and concrete encoding instances `E* = (D*, F*, W*, L*)` as defined in Section 3.
* Experiments and AI uses described here can falsify particular encoding instances `E*` at the effective layer.
* Falsifying an encoding instance `E*` does not falsify TU as a whole and does not settle the canonical biological problem.
* All fairness constraints on parameters and reference bands are part of `W` or `W*` and must be fixed before analysing any specific dataset or trajectory.

## 1. Canonical problem and status

### 1.1 Canonical statement

The canonical question behind Q077 is:

Can we describe host organisms and their associated microbial communities as a single co evolving system, with stable and reproducible principles that govern how host traits, microbiome composition, and environment shape each other over evolutionary and ecological time?

More concretely, Q077 asks whether there exists an effective law or family of laws that

* links host fitness and function to microbiome structure and dynamics,
* explains how host and microbiome jointly adapt to changing environments,
* accounts for both stability and plasticity of host associated communities across many species,
* does so in a way that can be captured by a small set of tension like quantities, rather than by enumerating every possible interaction.

This is not a single theorem in the traditional mathematical sense. It is a structured scientific problem about the existence and usefulness of co evolution principles at the host microbiome level.

This page does not claim that such a law already exists in final form. It specifies how Q077 is represented at the effective layer inside TU and which patterns of data would count as support or refutation for particular encodings.

### 1.2 Status and difficulty

Key points about current knowledge:

* Many studies show that microbiome composition correlates with host traits, health, and disease. However, correlations alone do not yield a compact co evolution law.
* There are strong examples of host microbe co evolution in specific systems, such as insect symbionts, gut microbiota in mammals, and plant root microbiomes. These examples do not automatically assemble into one unified principle.
* Conceptual frameworks such as the holobiont idea and meta organism views suggest that hosts and microbiomes can behave like composite units of selection. These frameworks remain debated, and quantitative laws are still emerging.
* High dimensionality, context dependence, and environmental variability make it hard to determine whether there is a small set of invariants that generalises across species and ecosystems.

As a result, Q077 is an open and difficult problem at the interface of evolutionary biology, ecology, microbiology, and systems science. It involves

* multi scale dynamics in time and space,
* strong stochastic effects and historical contingency,
* interactions between selection, drift, migration, and environmental forcing.

### 1.3 Role in the BlackHole project

Within the BlackHole S problem family, Q077 plays the following roles:

1. It is a flagship example of a dynamical_field problem in biology where selection acts on coupled host and community traits and where incentive_tension is central.
2. It anchors a cluster of problems about aging, immunity, biosphere adaptability, and planetary health, in particular Q071, Q073, Q074, Q075, Q076, Q080, Q095, Q098, and Q100.
3. It provides a test bed for TU encodings that must handle

   * hybrid semantics, where discrete host states and continuous community fields interact,
   * multi time scale dynamics from ecological to evolutionary,
   * competing incentives at host, microbe, and environment levels.

## 2. Position in the BlackHole graph

This block records how Q077 is positioned among Q001–Q125, using only Q identifiers and short reasons that refer to concrete components or tension types. It is written at the effective layer and assumes that the components named in Section 8 have been defined.

### 2.1 Upstream problems

Problems that provide prerequisites or conceptual tools for Q077.

* Q071 Origin of life
  Reason: defines constraints on early chemical and microbial networks that precede stable host microbiome systems and inform the low level structure of community fields used in `C_micro(m)`.

* Q073 Major evolutionary transitions
  Reason: supplies general multi level selection principles that are reused when host plus microbiome are treated as composite units in the `HostMicrobiomeTensionFunctional`.

* Q074 Robustness of cell differentiation
  Reason: provides models of stable host tissue states and niches that define boundary conditions for microbiome related fields inside `M_HM`.

* Q080 Limits of biosphere adaptability
  Reason: sets outer constraints on environmental regimes where host microbiome co evolution remains viable and defines large scale parameters that appear in `E_env(m)`.

### 2.2 Downstream problems

Problems that directly reuse components from Q077.

* Q075 Fundamental mechanisms of aging
  Reason: reuses `CoEvolutionTrajectoryDescriptor` and `DysbiosisRiskField` to relate long term microbiome shifts and dysbiosis tension to aging trajectories.

* Q076 Regeneration and repair principles
  Reason: reuses `HostMicrobiomeTensionFunctional` as a coupling between tissue level regeneration patterns and microbiome states, in particular when chronic inflammation or dysbiosis modulate regeneration tension.

### 2.3 Parallel problems

Problems with similar tension and field types but no strong component dependency.

* Q059 Information thermodynamics in computing systems
  Reason: both Q059 and Q077 study non equilibrium dynamical_field systems where maintenance and degradation compete under resource and incentive constraints, but Q059 focuses on information structures rather than host microbiome pairs.

* Q032 Quantum thermodynamics of small systems
  Reason: both treat open systems driven away from equilibrium where effective tension measures capture the gap between current configurations and feasible low tension regimes, though Q032 operates at quantum scale.

* Q080 Limits of biosphere adaptability
  Reason: both characterise adaptability as a balance between internal incentives and external stress, but Q080 works at biosphere and ecosystem scales rather than individual hosts.

### 2.4 Cross domain edges

Cross domain edges to problems in other domains.

* Q095 Drivers of biodiversity loss and recovery
  Reason: reuses `CoEvolutionTrajectoryDescriptor` as a micro scale analogue for species level biodiversity shifts and recovery paths under environmental change.

* Q098 Anthropocene system dynamics
  Reason: reuses dysbiosis and co evolution tension patterns as templates for coupled human environment system dynamics where infrastructure, behaviour, and microbial ecology interact.

* Q100 Environmental drivers of pandemic risk
  Reason: reuses `DysbiosisRiskField` as a micro scale signal for host susceptibility and pathogen emergence risk in models that combine contact networks, environmental forcing, and pathogen traits.

All graph edges respect the BlackHole bookkeeping rules, with between two and five upstream edges, two and five downstream edges, two and five parallel edges, and two and six cross domain edges for this node.

## 3. Tension Universe encoding (effective layer)

All content in this block stays at the effective layer. We describe only

* state spaces,
* fields and observables,
* invariants and tension scores,
* singular sets and domain restrictions.

We do not specify any hidden TU generative rule or explicit mapping from raw data into internal TU fields.

### 3.0 Encoding class and instances

For Q077 we use encoding classes of the form

```txt
E = (D, F, W, L)
```

where

* `D` is a family of admissible data to state maps that send raw observations from host, microbiome, and environment into states in `M_HM`.
* `F` is a collection of effective layer fields and observables on `M_HM`, including all maps defined in Sections 3.2 and 3.4.
* `W` is a set of admissible parameter and band choices, including

  * weights such as `alpha`, `beta`,
  * admissible band libraries `L_ref_HM`,
  * normalisation constants used in invariants.
* `L` is a list of host species and system classes for which the encoding is declared valid at the given resolution.

A concrete encoding instance is

```txt
E* = (D*, F*, W*, L*)
```

with all choices frozen. In what follows, when we speak about a fixed encoding, we implicitly work with some `E*` and restrict all experiments, invariants, and AI uses to that instance. Fairness rules constrain which `D*`, `F*`, `W*`, and `L*` are admissible, but once `E*` is chosen it is treated as fixed for the duration of an analysis.

### 3.1 State space

We introduce a state space

```txt
M_HM
```

Each state `m` in `M_HM` encodes a coherent snapshot of a host microbiome system at a chosen scale. For each `m` we assume

* there is a well defined host level descriptor that captures the traits of interest,
* there is a well defined summary of microbiome composition and interaction structure at the chosen sites,
* there is a description of the relevant environmental context at the host scale,
* there is a coarse summary of the recent trajectory, for example stable, recovering, or strongly perturbed.

We do not say how these summaries are computed from experimental or observational data. We only assume that for any real or model system that we care about there exists at least one state `m` in `M_HM` that encodes it at the effective layer under some admissible `D*` in `D`.

### 3.2 Fields and observables

On `M_HM` we define the following fields and observables. All of them belong to `F` in the encoding class.

1. Host trait summary

```txt
H_traits(m)
```

* A finite dimensional vector that summarises host properties relevant to co evolution, such as immune competence, metabolic status, and genetic markers.
* It is a map from `M_HM` to some `R^k_H` for fixed `k_H`.

2. Microbiome community composition

```txt
C_micro(m)
```

* A finite dimensional vector or low rank tensor that summarises microbial community structure at relevant body sites.
* It may encode abundances, diversity indices, and coarse interaction measures.
* It maps `M_HM` to some `R^k_C` for fixed `k_C`.

3. Environmental context

```txt
E_env(m)
```

* A finite dimensional vector capturing environmental and lifestyle factors that influence host and microbiome, such as diet class, antibiotic exposure, and habitat.
* It maps `M_HM` to some `R^k_E`.

4. Host effective performance

```txt
F_host(m)
```

* A scalar or low dimensional vector representing host performance or fitness proxies at the time scale of interest.
* Examples include survival probability, reproductive success indicators, or composite health scores.
* It maps `M_HM` to `R^k_F` with small `k_F`.

5. Microbiome effective performance

```txt
F_micro(m)
```

* A scalar or vector representing community level success, such as persistence, resilience to perturbations, or transmission potential.
* It maps `M_HM` to `R^k_M` with small `k_M`.

6. Alignment mismatch observable

```txt
DeltaS_align(m)
```

* A non negative scalar that measures misalignment between host level and microbiome level incentives or interests at state `m`.
* When host and microbiome tendencies are well aligned, `DeltaS_align(m)` is small.
* When persistent conflicts exist, `DeltaS_align(m)` is large.

7. Environmental mismatch observable

```txt
DeltaS_env(m)
```

* A non negative scalar that measures mismatch between the joint host microbiome system and its environment at state `m`.
* It grows when external conditions push the system far away from its past co evolved regimes.

All these observables are assumed to be well defined and finite on a regular subset of `M_HM` specified in Section 3.5.

### 3.3 Effective tension tensor

We define a TU style effective tension tensor for Q077:

```txt
T_ij(m) = S_i(m) * C_j(m) * Tension_HM(m) * lambda(m) * kappa_HM
```

where

* `S_i(m)` are source like factors representing contributions of different channels of host or environmental influence.
* `C_j(m)` are sensitivity like factors representing how strongly different response channels are affected by host microbiome tension.
* `Tension_HM(m)` is the scalar tension functional defined in Section 4.1.
* `lambda(m)` is the standard TU convergence state factor, which encodes whether local adaptation and learning are convergent, recursive, divergent, or chaotic.
* `kappa_HM` is a positive constant that sets the overall scale of incentive_tension for Q077.

We do not need the explicit index sets of `i` and `j` at the effective layer. We only require that for every `m` in the regular domain these products are finite and that `kappa_HM` is part of the admissible parameter set `W`.

### 3.4 Invariants, bands, and reference library

We define effective invariants used to characterise host microbiome co evolution and an admissible library of tension bands.

1. Alignment score

```txt
Align_score(m) = G(H_traits(m), C_micro(m), F_host(m), F_micro(m))
```

where `G` is a fixed non negative function satisfying

* `Align_score(m)` is small if host and microbiome performance indicators are jointly high and compatible under the current environment.
* `Align_score(m)` increases when improving microbiome performance worsens host performance or the reverse, at fixed environment.

For the E1 encoding we identify

```txt
DeltaS_align(m) = Align_score(m)
```

Other encodings may separate them, but here they coincide.

2. Admissible band library

We introduce an admissible reference library

```txt
L_ref_HM = {B_1, B_2, ..., B_K}
```

Each element `B_k` in `L_ref_HM` specifies

* a low tension band `[band_min(k), band_max(k)]` for `Tension_HM`,
* species or system classes for which this band is applicable,
* normalisation choices relevant for cross species comparisons.

Fairness constraints:

* The library `L_ref_HM` is specified as part of `W` before analysing any concrete trajectory.
* For a given study and host class, a single `B_k` is selected from `L_ref_HM` by rules that depend only on coarse class labels and not on detailed outcome patterns.
* Once chosen, `B_k` is fixed for all states and individuals in that study and is part of the instantiated parameter set `W*`.

3. Recovery invariant

Given a trajectory `(m_t)` indexed by time steps `t` after a perturbation we define a recovery invariant

```txt
I_recovery = fraction of time steps t in a post perturbation window
             where Tension_HM(m_t) <= band_max(k*)
```

where `band_max(k*)` is the upper limit of the chosen band `B_k*` from `L_ref_HM` for that study. We require

* `0 <= I_recovery <= 1` for any trajectory,
* `I_recovery` is computed only on states in the regular domain `M_HM_reg`.

4. Cross species regularity indicator

We define a cross species indicator

```txt
I_cross = variation of band_max(k) across comparable host species
```

under a standard normalisation of `Tension_HM`. For a meaningful Q077 encoding we expect `I_cross` to be bounded when we compare species that share ecological niches and basic physiology.

The precise functional form of `G`, the construction of `L_ref_HM`, and the normalisation rules are part of `W` and must be fixed as part of `W*` for a given encoding instance.

### 3.5 Singular set and domain restrictions

Some states in `M_HM` may fail to have well defined or finite observables, for example

* incomplete or inconsistent summaries of host or microbiome,
* incompatible environmental labels,
* situations where the encoding breaks down.

We collect these states into a singular set

```txt
S_sing_HM = { m in M_HM :
              DeltaS_align(m) is undefined or not finite
              or DeltaS_env(m) is undefined or not finite }
```

The regular domain is

```txt
M_HM_reg = M_HM \ S_sing_HM
```

Domain restriction:

* All Q077 tension quantities such as `T_ij(m)` or `Tension_HM(m)` are only defined and interpreted on `M_HM_reg`.
* Whenever an experiment, simulation, or AI module would require evaluating those quantities at a state in `S_sing_HM`, the result is treated as out of domain and carries no direct implication for the validity of the encoding instance `E*` or for the biological canonical statement.

---

## 4. Tension principle for this problem

This block states how Q077 is phrased as a tension principle at the effective layer, assuming a fixed encoding instance `E* = (D*, F*, W*, L*)`.

### 4.1 Core tension functional

We define an effective host microbiome tension functional

```txt
Tension_HM(m) = alpha * DeltaS_align(m) + beta * DeltaS_env(m)
```

with constants `alpha > 0` and `beta > 0`.

Encoding and fairness rules:

* `alpha` and `beta` belong to the admissible parameter set `W` and are chosen once per host type or study class, before looking at detailed outcome patterns.
* `alpha` and `beta` are constrained to lie within a bounded interval given by domain expertise.
* Within a fixed encoding instance `E*` we do not retune `alpha` and `beta` to individual trajectories in order to obtain desired tension profiles.

For a given `E*` we require

* `Tension_HM(m) >= 0` for all `m` in `M_HM_reg`,
* `Tension_HM(m)` is small when host microbe alignment and environmental match are good,
* `Tension_HM(m)` becomes large when misalignment or environmental mismatch is persistent.

### 4.2 Low tension co evolution principle

The low tension version of Q077 states:

For viable and co evolved host microbiome systems, there exists a resolution scale and a regular domain of states such that trajectories of the real system spend most of their time in a bounded low tension band, under some admissible encoding instance `E*`.

More concretely, we assume a family of refinement levels indexed by an integer `k`

```txt
refine(k)
```

At level `k` we use a more detailed encoding of host traits and community structure, for example more features in `H_traits` and `C_micro`. For each refinement level `k` we require the existence of a low tension band

```txt
0 <= band_min(k) <= band_max(k)
```

with the following properties:

* For trajectories of real co evolved host microbiome systems, most states `m` at level `k` satisfy

  ```txt
  Tension_HM(m) <= band_max(k)
  ```

* The upper bound does not diverge under refinement: there exists a finite constant `B` such that

  ```txt
  sup over k of band_max(k) <= B
  ```

for the species or system class under study.

This does not claim that such a band already has been measured. It specifies what it would mean, at the effective layer, for a co evolution principle to keep tension bounded.

### 4.3 High tension breakdown principle

The high tension version describes worlds or parameter regimes where host microbiome co evolution breaks down under any admissible encoding instance.

In such worlds

* for any encoding and refinement family `refine(k)` that satisfy the fairness rules there exists a refinement level `k_0` and a positive constant `delta_HM` such that for typical trajectories we have

  ```txt
  Tension_HM(m) >= delta_HM
  ```

  on a non negligible fraction of time steps at level `k_0`,
* refining further beyond `k_0` does not reduce this lower bound in a stable way, tension stays high or becomes more erratic.

At the effective layer Q077 distinguishes between worlds where bounded low tension co evolution is possible and worlds where persistent high tension is unavoidable for host microbiome systems.

---

## 5. Counterfactual tension worlds

We define counterfactual worlds in terms of patterns of observables and tension. No hidden TU generative mechanisms are described.

### 5.1 World T_HM (co evolution principle holds)

In World T_HM:

1. Long term alignment

   * For typical host species and environments, there exist regular domains and refinement levels such that

     ```txt
     Tension_HM(m) stays mostly within a bounded species specific band
     ```

     along evolutionary and ecological trajectories.

2. Recovery after perturbation

   * After moderate perturbations such as diet change, short antibiotic courses, or migration, trajectories show

     * an increase in `Tension_HM(m)` for a limited time,
     * followed by relaxation back into the low tension band, with recovery invariant `I_recovery` close to 1 for many episodes.

3. Cross species patterns

   * The cross species indicator `I_cross` stays bounded across related host species that share ecological niches. This suggests that similar co evolution principles apply in different lineages.

4. Dysbiosis as high tension exception

   * States with very high `Tension_HM(m)` exist and correspond to dysbiosis or disease. They are exceptions rather than the dominant behaviour in the regular domain.

### 5.2 World F_HM (no simple co evolution principle)

In World F_HM:

1. Persistent misalignment

   * For many host species and environments, typical trajectories show frequent and long periods where

     ```txt
     Tension_HM(m) is large and does not reliably return to a bounded band
     ```

     even after long times without further external shocks.

2. Unstable recovery

   * The recovery invariant `I_recovery` is low for many perturbation episodes. Repeated perturbations can push the system into new high tension attractors that do not resemble prior states.

3. Lack of cross species regularity

   * The indicator `I_cross` is large. Different host species show widely different tension scales and patterns, with no clear grouping by ecology or phylogeny.

4. Dysbiosis as default

   * High tension regimes are common and may be the default state under the encoding, making it difficult to distinguish genuine co evolved systems from chronic maladaptation.

### 5.3 Interpretive note

The distinction between World T_HM and World F_HM is not a claim about which world we inhabit. It is a way to structure

* which observable patterns we should look for in data,
* how we interpret trajectories of `Tension_HM(m)`,
* how we design experiments that can falsify particular encoding instances `E*`.

No step in this description requires or reveals any TU bottom layer generative rule.

---

## 6. Falsifiability and discriminating experiments

This block specifies experiments and protocols that can falsify or support particular Q077 encodings at the effective layer. They operate under a fixed encoding instance `E*` and do not by themselves prove or disprove any final biological theory.

### Experiment 1: Longitudinal tension profiling in cohorts

Goal:
Test whether a simple `Tension_HM` functional can provide a stable, predictive band structure for host health and microbiome resilience over time in real cohorts.

Setup:

* Select one or more host species with existing longitudinal microbiome cohorts, for example humans or model organisms.
* At multiple time points for each individual, obtain summaries corresponding to `H_traits(m)`, `C_micro(m)`, and `E_env(m)`.
* Use a fixed encoding instance `E*` to construct effective states `m_t` in `M_HM_reg` at a chosen refinement level `k`.
* Fix encoding parameters in `W*` for `Tension_HM`, including `alpha`, `beta`, band thresholds from an element `B_k*` in `L_ref_HM`, and the function `G` used in `Align_score`, before looking at outcome patterns.

Protocol:

1. For each time point, compute `DeltaS_align(m_t)`, `DeltaS_env(m_t)`, and then `Tension_HM(m_t)`, restricted to states in `M_HM_reg`.
2. Mark perturbation events such as strong diet changes, antibiotic courses, or illnesses.
3. For each perturbation episode, compute the recovery invariant `I_recovery` as the fraction of time points in a post perturbation window where `Tension_HM(m_t)` lies below the band maximum of `B_k*`.
4. For each individual and for the cohort as a whole, record

   * baseline tension distribution,
   * distribution of peak tension during perturbations,
   * recovery behaviour.

Metrics:

* Fraction of individuals for whom baseline `Tension_HM` stays within a stable band over extended periods.
* Typical values of `I_recovery` across episodes and species.
* Predictive power of baseline and early post perturbation tension measures for coarse health outcomes.

Falsification conditions:

* If, across multiple cohorts and species, no choice of encoding instance `E*` that respects the fairness rules produces

  * stable tension bands with bounded band maxima, and
  * nontrivial predictive power for health or resilience outcomes,
    then the family of `E` considered for Q077 is falsified at the E1 level for that data regime.
* If minor parameter changes within the admissible set `W` can produce arbitrarily different conclusions about stability and recovery, then the encoding instance `E*` is considered unstable and rejected.

Semantics implementation note:
All state summaries and tension quantities in this experiment follow hybrid semantics. Host level descriptors and event markers are treated as discrete components, while community compositions and performance measures are treated as continuous components. All evaluations are restricted to `M_HM_reg`.

Boundary note:
Falsifying an encoding instance `E*` for Q077 does not solve the canonical statement and does not settle whether some other encoding in the same class could succeed.

---

### Experiment 2: Controlled co evolution in model systems

Goal:
Assess whether Q077 style encodings can distinguish between experimental regimes that favour host microbiome co evolution and regimes that disrupt it.

Setup:

* Use model organisms with controllable microbiota, such as gnotobiotic animals or simplified host systems with defined communities.
* Design two types of regimes:

  * co evolution friendly regimes with stable environments and moderate perturbations,
  * disruptive regimes with repeated strong perturbations such as antibiotics or extreme diet shifts.
* For each regime and replicate, use `D*` in `E*` to construct sequences of states `m_t` in `M_HM_reg` that encode host traits, microbiome composition, and environment at a fixed refinement level.

Protocol:

1. For each regime and replicate, compute `Tension_HM(m_t)` over time using the fixed `F*` and `W*`.
2. Compute regime specific statistics such as

   * average tension over long windows,
   * frequency and duration of high tension episodes,
   * recovery invariants conditional on perturbation events.
3. Compare statistics between co evolution friendly and disruptive regimes.
4. Optionally, explore small parameter variations within `W*` that remain inside predefined fairness bounds and check robustness of conclusions.

Metrics:

* Difference in mean and variance of `Tension_HM` between regimes.
* Differences in `I_recovery` between regimes.
* Robustness of these differences under small, constrained changes in encoding parameters.

Falsification conditions:

* If the encoding instance `E*` fails to produce systematic differences in tension statistics between co evolution friendly and disruptive regimes, despite clear differences in host and microbiome outcomes, then `E*` is considered ineffective for Q077.
* If encodings within the admissible class predict lower tension in obviously disruptive regimes than in co evolution friendly regimes, and this behaviour persists under parameter variations inside fairness bounds, then that part of the encoding class is considered misaligned and should be revised.

Semantics implementation note:
Model systems are encoded with the same hybrid semantics as real cohorts. Host treatments, environmental switches, and community manipulations are recorded as discrete components, while population level summaries are continuous. All results are interpreted only on `M_HM_reg`.

Boundary note:
Experiments on model systems can support or reject particular encoding instances for Q077. They do not provide a full theory of host microbiome co evolution and do not by themselves decide which counterfactual world description is realised.

---

## 7. AI and WFGY engineering spec

This block describes how Q077 can be used in AI systems within WFGY, strictly at the effective layer and under a fixed encoding instance `E* = (D*, F*, W*, L*)`. All modules inspect or reuse effective layer observables and tension scores, and none of them infer or expose TU bottom layer rules.

### 7.1 Training signals

We define training signals that reuse Q077 observables.

1. `signal_microbiome_alignment`

   * Definition: a penalty proportional to `DeltaS_align(m)` in contexts where the model is expected to describe healthy or co evolved host microbiome relationships.
   * Purpose: encourage the model to represent such contexts with low alignment tension.

2. `signal_dysbiosis_risk`

   * Definition: a risk score derived from `Tension_HM(m)`, scaled into a fixed range, for example via a monotone map that defines `DysbiosisRiskField`.
   * Purpose: help the model identify narratives or scenarios that correspond to microbiome related instability, disease, or high risk.

3. `signal_longitudinal_stability`

   * Definition: a reward based on high recovery invariant `I_recovery` in imagined or simulated trajectories consistent with `E*`.
   * Purpose: encourage the model to construct multistep explanations in which host microbiome systems return to plausible low tension bands after moderate perturbations.

4. `signal_cross_species_regularities`

   * Definition: a regularisation signal that penalises large and unjustified variation in inferred tension patterns across related host species and ecological niches, measured against the cross species indicator `I_cross`.
   * Purpose: reduce arbitrary variation in co evolution encodings across similar species.

### 7.2 Architectural patterns

We outline module patterns that can reuse Q077 structures.

1. `HM_TensionHead`

   * Role: a module that reads an internal representation of a host microbiome context and outputs an estimate of `Tension_HM(m)` along with decomposed contributions from alignment and environment.
   * Interface:

     * Input: hidden representation of the context, optionally with structured fields for host, microbiome, and environment that align with `H_traits`, `C_micro`, and `E_env`.
     * Output: scalar tension estimate and a small vector of components such as `DeltaS_align` and `DeltaS_env`.

2. `HM_TrajectoryFilter`

   * Role: a module that evaluates multistep narratives about host microbiome dynamics and flags trajectories with implausible tension patterns under `E*`.
   * Interface:

     * Input: sequence of hidden states representing successive time points.
     * Output: summary features of tension evolution including recovery scores and high tension episode markers.

3. `HM_RiskAnnotator`

   * Role: a lightweight module that attaches risk annotations to clinical or ecological scenarios involving microbiomes, based on `DysbiosisRiskField`.
   * Interface:

     * Input: hidden representation of a single time point scenario.
     * Output: risk score and categorical tag such as low, moderate, or high risk.

These modules consume effective layer observables defined by `F*` and do not modify the encoding instance.

### 7.3 Evaluation harness

We suggest an evaluation harness to test AI models equipped with Q077 modules.

1. Task families

   * Explanatory tasks: explain how microbiome changes might affect host health under different perturbations.
   * Predictive tasks: predict which of several described interventions is more likely to restore a healthy state.
   * Consistency tasks: maintain coherent narratives over several steps of host microbiome evolution.

2. Conditions

   * Baseline condition: the model operates without explicit Q077 modules.
   * TU condition: the model uses `HM_TensionHead` and `HM_TrajectoryFilter` outputs as auxiliary signals during training or decoding.

3. Metrics

   * Human rated plausibility and coherence of explanations.
   * Consistency between short term and long term predictions across prompts.
   * Agreement with basic patterns observed in cohort or model system data, where such data have been encoded under `E*`.

The goal is to test whether Q077 style encoding improves structured reasoning about host microbiome systems, without giving the model access to TU bottom layer rules.

### 7.4 60 second reproduction protocol

This protocol allows external users to experience Q077 style encoding in a short interaction.

Baseline setup:

* Prompt the AI with a scenario that includes a host species, a brief description of its microbiome, an environmental change, and an open question about likely outcomes.
* Ask for an explanation of short term and long term consequences without naming any tension concepts.

TU encoded setup:

* Use a similar scenario, but now explicitly instruct the AI to

  * think in terms of host microbiome co evolution,
  * use a single number `Tension_HM` to track misalignment and mismatch across time,
  * describe how this tension evolves after the perturbation.

Comparison metric:

* Compare the two answers in terms of

  * clarity of the link between host traits, microbiome composition, and environment,
  * consistency of the described trajectory over several steps,
  * ability to distinguish low tension recovery paths from high tension failure paths.

What to log:

* Prompts and full responses for both setups.
* Any auxiliary tension estimates produced by Q077 modules.
* Simple derived scores measuring coherence and recovery patterns.

These logs enable later analysis without exposing TU bottom layer structure.

## 8. Cross problem transfer template

This block describes reusable components from Q077 and explicit reuse targets. All components live at the effective layer and are defined relative to a fixed encoding instance `E*`.

### 8.1 Reusable components produced by this problem

1. ComponentName: `HostMicrobiomeTensionFunctional`

   * Type: functional
   * Minimal interface:

     * Inputs: `H_traits_summary`, `C_micro_summary`, `E_env_summary`
     * Output: `tension_value` as a non negative scalar
   * Preconditions:

     * Summaries must be coherent and refer to the same host, microbiome, and environment snapshot.
     * Inputs must lie within the ranges covered by the encoding that defines `DeltaS_align` and `DeltaS_env`.

2. ComponentName: `CoEvolutionTrajectoryDescriptor`

   * Type: experiment_pattern
   * Minimal interface:

     * Inputs: sequence of states `(m_t)` in `M_HM_reg` over a specified time window.
     * Output: aggregate descriptors such as baseline tension, peak tension, recovery invariant, and number of high tension episodes.
   * Preconditions:

     * The sequence is time ordered and sampled at an appropriate resolution for the host microbiome system.
     * Each state has a well defined `Tension_HM(m_t)`.

3. ComponentName: `DysbiosisRiskField`

   * Type: observable
   * Minimal interface:

     * Inputs: single state `m` in `M_HM_reg`.
     * Output: risk score in a fixed range, for example between 0 and 1, that indicates the probability or tendency of being in or near a high tension regime.
   * Preconditions:

     * Thresholds for mapping `Tension_HM(m)` to risk scores are fixed for each species or class of systems and are part of `W*`, not tuned per individual trajectory.

### 8.2 Direct reuse targets

1. Q075 Fundamental mechanisms of aging

   * Reused components: `CoEvolutionTrajectoryDescriptor`, `DysbiosisRiskField`.
   * Why it transfers: aging theories increasingly consider the microbiome as a factor in long term host decline. Tension trajectories and risk scores provide structured descriptors for these effects.
   * What changes: aging specific observables such as damage accumulation indicators are added as extra inputs to the trajectory descriptor and risk field.

2. Q076 Regeneration and repair principles

   * Reused component: `HostMicrobiomeTensionFunctional`.
   * Why it transfers: immune and tissue repair dynamics are coupled to microbiome structure, especially in chronic inflammatory states. Measuring tension between host repair architecture and microbiome profiles helps describe these couplings.
   * What changes: additional host regenerative features are added to `H_traits_summary`, and tension outputs are interpreted together with regeneration mismatch fields.

3. Q080 Limits of biosphere adaptability

   * Reused component: `CoEvolutionTrajectoryDescriptor`.
   * Why it transfers: biosphere adaptability can be viewed as the aggregate of many co evolving host microbiome systems. Trajectory descriptors from Q077 serve as micro scale templates.
   * What changes: descriptors are aggregated or coarse grained across many hosts and habitats to form biosphere level observables.

4. Q100 Environmental drivers of pandemic risk

   * Reused component: `DysbiosisRiskField`.
   * Why it transfers: high dysbiosis risk in host populations may correlate with increased susceptibility to infection or pathogen emergence.
   * What changes: risk scores are combined with pathogen traits and contact network observables to form integrated pandemic risk indicators.

## 9. TU roadmap and verification levels

This block explains the current verification levels for Q077 and outlines next steps at the effective layer.

### 9.1 Current levels

* E_level: E1

  * The state space `M_HM` and core observables `H_traits`, `C_micro`, `E_env`, `F_host`, `F_micro`, `DeltaS_align`, and `DeltaS_env` have been specified at the effective layer inside an encoding class `E`.
  * A concrete tension functional `Tension_HM` has been defined with fairness constraints on parameters and band libraries.
  * At least two discriminating experiment patterns with explicit falsification conditions have been described for encoding instances `E*`.

* N_level: N1

  * A coherent narrative presents Q077 as a host microbiome co evolution tension problem without claiming a complete biological theory.
  * Counterfactual worlds World T_HM and World F_HM have been described and linked to observables and tension patterns.

### 9.2 Next measurable step toward E2

To move from E1 to E2, at least one of the following should be implemented:

1. Build a prototype tool that

   * accepts pre processed cohort data as inputs,
   * uses a documented `D*` to construct effective states `m_t`,
   * computes `Tension_HM`, recovery invariants, and `DysbiosisRiskField`,
   * publishes resulting tension profiles and descriptors for selected cohorts with code to recompute them.

2. Run controlled model system experiments where

   * co evolution friendly and disruptive regimes are imposed,
   * a concrete encoding instance `E*` is pre specified and frozen before data analysis,
   * results clearly show whether the encoding is capable of discriminating regimes in the way predicted in Experiment 2.

Both steps operate entirely on observable summaries and do not require exposing any TU bottom layer machinery.

### 9.3 Long term role in the TU program

In the longer term, Q077 is expected to

* serve as the central node for biological co evolution problems involving complex communities on individual hosts,
* link micro scale host microbiome dynamics to macro scale biosphere adaptability and planetary health through structured transfer of descriptors,
* provide a template for designing AI systems that reason about health, ecology, and sustainability using tension based representations instead of only static correlations.

Success or failure of Q077 encodings in practice will inform how TU can or cannot be applied to multi scale biological systems.

## 10. Elementary but precise explanation

This block offers a non specialist explanation that remains faithful to the effective layer description.

Many organisms live together with large communities of microbes. For example, the human gut contains a huge and diverse microbiome. These microbes

* help break down food,
* train the immune system,
* sometimes cause disease.

Over long periods of time, hosts and microbes can adapt to each other. This process is called co evolution. The core question of Q077 is:

Can we describe this co evolution with a small number of stable quantities that tell us when things are going well and when they are going badly?

In the TU view we imagine that each possible situation is a state. Each state summarises

* what the host looks like at the level we care about,
* what the microbiome looks like as a whole,
* what the environment is doing.

For each state we compute two kinds of mismatch:

* how badly host and microbiome interests clash,
* how badly the host microbiome pair fits the environment.

We combine these into a single number called `Tension_HM`. When this number is small, host and microbes are in a comfortable relationship that fits the environment. When the number is large, there is conflict or mismatch.

Then we look at two kinds of possible worlds:

* In a good world, co evolution has produced rules that keep `Tension_HM` usually small and allow it to come back down after disturbances.
* In a bad world, there is no such rule. Tension stays high or jumps around without returning to a stable band.

Q077 does not claim that we already know which world we live in. Instead, it

* defines clearly what we mean by tension and co evolution at this level,
* proposes experiments to test whether simple tension laws can work for real cohorts and model systems,
* provides building blocks that other problems can call when they need a notion of host microbiome co evolution, aging effects, or dysbiosis risk.

All of this stays at the effective layer. We work with what we can observe and summarise, without claiming to know the deepest rules that create host microbiome systems.

## Tension Universe effective layer footer

This page is part of the WFGY / Tension Universe S problem collection.

### Scope of claims

* The goal of this document is to specify an effective layer encoding of the named problem Q077.
* It does not claim to prove or disprove the canonical statement in Section 1.
* It does not introduce any new theorem beyond what is already established in the cited literature.
* It should not be cited as evidence that the corresponding open problem in biology or TU has been solved.

### Effective layer boundary

* All objects used here state spaces, observables, invariants, tension scores, counterfactual worlds live at the effective layer of TU.
* No TU bottom layer axioms, generative rules, or constructive mappings from raw data into TU fields are specified or assumed unique in this page.
* Any reference to convergence, divergence, or tensor structure is purely at the level of effective descriptions.

### Encoding and fairness

* All tension functionals, band libraries, and parameter choices are part of encoding classes `E` and instances `E*` defined at the effective layer.
* Fairness constraints require that parameters and bands are fixed before analysing specific datasets or trajectories and are not retuned to obtain desired outcomes.
* Falsification statements in Section 6 apply only to specific encoding instances `E*` and do not claim to falsify TU as a whole or the underlying scientific fields.

### Relation to TU charters

This page should be read together with the following charters:

* [TU Effective Layer Charter](../Charters/TU_EFFECTIVE_LAYER_CHARTER.md)
* [TU Encoding and Fairness Charter](../Charters/TU_ENCODING_AND_FAIRNESS_CHARTER.md)

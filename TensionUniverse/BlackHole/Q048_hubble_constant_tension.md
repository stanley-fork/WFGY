## 0. Effective layer disclaimer

All content in this entry is restricted to the effective layer of the Tension Universe (TU) framework.

* The goal of Q048 is to specify an effective layer encoding of the Hubble constant tension.
* The canonical problem in Section 1 remains an open cosmological question. This page does not claim to solve it, to prove or disprove any standard statement about H0, or to introduce new theorems in cosmology or statistics.
* All objects that appear here, such as state spaces, observables, invariants, tension functionals, counterfactual worlds, experiments, and engineering modules, are defined only as effective layer constructs.
* We do not describe any TU bottom layer axioms, any internal generative rules, or any constructive procedures that build TU states from raw data. We only assume that TU compatible models exist that can realise the effective layer structures.
* Any practical implementation of these encodings requires separate source code, data processing pipelines, and numerical choices. Those choices are outside the scope of this document and must not be inferred from it.
* Nothing in this page should be cited as evidence that the real universe is in a specific H0 regime, or that a specific physical explanation of the H0 tension has been confirmed or refuted.

Within these boundaries, Q048 provides a structured way to talk about H0 tension as a consistency_tension problem and to define falsifiable encodings and experiments at the effective layer.

## 1. Canonical problem and status

### 1.1 Canonical statement

The Hubble constant tension is the apparent inconsistency between different high precision measurements of the present day expansion rate of the universe, usually denoted as H0.

In the standard cosmological model, a single parameter H0 describes the late time expansion rate. Inferences of H0 that are based on different observables and different epochs are expected to be mutually consistent once known systematics are controlled and a shared model class is used.

In practice:

* Early universe probes such as the cosmic microwave background (CMB), interpreted within a standard flat LCDM model, yield one preferred range of H0.
* Late universe probes such as distance ladder measurements that use Cepheids and type Ia supernovae yield a higher preferred range of H0.
* Other probes, such as strong lensing time delays and standard sirens, add additional constraints that sometimes lie in between or follow their own patterns.

The canonical problem can be phrased as:

> Given current high precision cosmological data sets and an agreed baseline model class, do all admissible encodings of these data into an effective expansion parameter H0 converge to a mutually consistent value, or is there a persistent, statistically significant tension that cannot be removed without introducing qualitatively new ingredients?

This formulation does not assume that any particular data set is correct or that the standard model is final. It only records that there is a nontrivial, unresolved consistency problem.

### 1.2 Status and difficulty

At the time of writing:

* CMB based analyses under flat LCDM, such as Planck 2018, typically infer H0 in the high 60s in units km s^-1 Mpc^-1, with comparatively small quoted uncertainties.
* Local distance ladder analyses, such as SH0ES style programs, typically infer H0 in the low to mid 70s, also with small quoted uncertainties.
* Alternative calibration schemes, for example those that use the tip of the red giant branch, and other probes sometimes yield values closer to the CMB based values, although they carry different systematics.

When these results are compared under shared model assumptions, the disagreement is often quoted at the few sigma level. The precise significance depends on:

* which data sets are included,
* how systematics are treated,
* which extensions to the baseline cosmological model are allowed.

There is no consensus on whether:

* the tension is mainly due to unaccounted systematics or hidden correlations,
* modest extensions of the standard model can resolve it,
* new physics is required,
* or some combination of these.

There is also no unique, universally accepted scalar summary of “the” H0 tension. Different groups define different tension measures, which is part of what makes the problem subtle.

### 1.3 Role in the BlackHole project

Within the BlackHole S problem collection, Q048 plays the following roles:

1. It is a central example of consistency_tension in a mature physical science. Several sophisticated inference pipelines that aim at the same parameter fail to agree within their stated uncertainties.

2. It links multiple cosmology nodes, including:

   * dark matter and dark energy content,
   * large scale structure,
   * early universe initial conditions,
   * modelling of astrophysical distance indicators.

3. It provides a test bed for TU encodings of:

   * cross probe consistency functionals,
   * multi experiment state spaces and invariants,
   * families of refined encodings indexed by an explicit resolution parameter.

## 2. Position in the BlackHole graph

This block records how Q048 sits inside the BlackHole graph as nodes and edges among Q001 to Q125. Each edge is listed with a one line reason that points to a concrete component or tension type.

### 2.1 Upstream problems

These problems provide prerequisites, tools or foundations that Q048 relies on.

* Q041 (BH_COSMO_DARKMATTER_L3_041)
  Reason: supplies dark matter content and clustering assumptions that enter both early and late universe H0 inferences.

* Q042 (BH_COSMO_DARKENERGY_L3_042)
  Reason: provides the late time acceleration model that relates distance indicators and redshift to an effective H0.

* Q043 (BH_COSMO_INFLATION_L3_043)
  Reason: sets initial conditions for the CMB anisotropies used in early universe H0 determinations.

* Q044 (BH_COSMO_IC_L3_044)
  Reason: encodes assumptions about initial smoothness and low entropy that support the background cosmological model used here.

### 2.2 Downstream problems

These problems reuse Q048 components or depend on its tension structure.

* Q045 (BH_COSMO_LSS_L3_045)
  Reason: reuses the multi probe cross consistency functional defined here to test large scale structure probes against CMB and local H0.

* Q050 (BH_COSMO_MULTIUNI_L3_050)
  Reason: uses the H0_TensionFunctional as a prototype for multi world comparisons of cosmological parameter consistency.

* Q059 (BH_CS_INFO_THERMODYN_L3_059)
  Reason: adopts the information view of cross experiment tension that is first formalised in Q048.

### 2.3 Parallel problems

Parallel nodes share a similar tension type but have no direct component dependence.

* Q040 (BH_PHYS_QBLACKHOLE_INFO_L3_040)
  Reason: both nodes require consistency_tension between different encodings of the same physical quantity, here information content versus H0.

* Q098 (BH_EARTH_ANTHROPOCENE_L3_098)
  Reason: both study cross probe tensions between historical and current measurements of a global state.

### 2.4 Cross domain edges

Cross domain edges connect Q048 to problems in other domains that can reuse its components.

* Q032 (BH_PHYS_QTHERMO_L3_032)
  Reason: can reuse the multi reservoir consistency idea, where different thermodynamic probes of the same quantity play the role of early and late universe H0 probes.

* Q121 (BH_AI_ALIGNMENT_L3_121)
  Reason: uses Q048 as a worked example of a high stakes inference mismatch that an aligned AI should detect, quantify and communicate instead of averaging away.

## 3. Tension Universe encoding (effective layer)

All content in this block is at the effective layer. We only describe:

* state spaces,
* observables and fields,
* invariants and tension scores,
* singular sets and domain restrictions.

We do not describe any hidden generative rules or the construction of internal TU fields from raw observational data.

### 3.1 State space and admissible encodings

We assume the existence of a state space

```txt
M
```

of “cosmology inference states for H0”. Each element `m` in `M` represents a coherent effective encoding of:

* summaries of early universe probes relevant for H0,
* summaries of late universe probes relevant for H0,
* the model class and nuisance parameter treatment used in those inferences.

We assume a family of resolution levels indexed by integers `k >= 0`. For each world model and each admissible encoding, there exists a sequence of states

```txt
m_enc(k) in M,  k = 0, 1, 2, ...
```

where higher `k` correspond to refinements in the practical sense:

* more precise or more complete data,
* more detailed modelling of systematics,
* more systematic inclusion of probes.

We do not specify how any `m_enc(k)` is constructed from raw data. We only assume that:

* for any fixed modelling protocol, set of probes, and encoding rule, there exists at least one sequence `m_enc(k)` that encodes the resulting effective summaries,
* the refinement index `k` is monotone in the sense that larger `k` reflect strictly richer or more precise encodings.

We also assume an admissible encoding class

```txt
E_adm
```

which is a set of rules that map given probe combinations and baseline model classes into sequences of states in `M`. The class `E_adm` is fixed at design time. It is not allowed to depend on the specific numerical outcomes of the probes in the world under study and it is not tuned per world.

For a given world and an encoding rule `enc` in `E_adm`, the corresponding refinement sequence of states is denoted by

```txt
{ m_enc(k) }_{k >= 0}
```

and is always considered as a sequence in `M`.

### 3.2 Effective fields and observables

We introduce the following observables on `M`.

1. Early universe H0 summary

```txt
H0_early(m) in R
```

A real valued scalar that summarises the inferred H0 from early universe probes, for example CMB and BAO, in state `m`.

2. Late universe H0 summary

```txt
H0_late(m) in R
```

A real valued scalar that summarises the inferred H0 from late universe probes, for example distance ladder, strong lensing, and standard sirens, in state `m`.

3. Early and late uncertainty scales

```txt
Sigma_early(m) > 0
Sigma_late(m) > 0
```

Positive real numbers that capture effective one sigma scales for the early and late H0 determinations encoded in `m`. They combine statistical and systematic components at the effective layer.

4. Baseline mismatch observables

We fix in advance a baseline cosmological model and pipeline class

```txt
B_base
```

independent of any particular world. For each `m` in `M` we define:

```txt
DeltaS_early(m) >= 0
DeltaS_late(m)  >= 0
```

* `DeltaS_early(m)` measures how strongly the early universe summaries in `m` deviate from what `B_base` would predict when fit to those data.
* `DeltaS_late(m)` measures the analogous deviation for late universe summaries.

These observables satisfy:

```txt
DeltaS_early(m) = 0 only if early summaries match B_base within design tolerance
DeltaS_late(m)  = 0 only if late summaries match B_base within design tolerance
```

The notion of design tolerance is fixed at encoding design time. It is not chosen by inspecting any particular world.

5. Cross probe H0 mismatch observable

We define a cross probe mismatch:

```txt
DeltaS_cross(m) = G(H0_early(m), H0_late(m),
                   Sigma_early(m), Sigma_late(m))
```

where `G` is a fixed nonnegative function chosen at encoding design time with the following properties:

* It depends on the H0 summaries only through dimensionless combinations such as

  ```txt
  d_H0(m) = |H0_early(m) - H0_late(m)| /
            sqrt( Sigma_early(m)^2 + Sigma_late(m)^2 )
  ```

* It is monotone nondecreasing in `d_H0(m)`.

* It satisfies `DeltaS_cross(m) = 0` if and only if `H0_early(m)` and `H0_late(m)` are equal within a small multiple of the combined uncertainty.

The function `G` is fixed for the entire admissible encoding class `E_adm`. It is not allowed to be altered after seeing the numerical values for a specific world.

### 3.3 Effective tension components and weights

We define an aggregate mismatch:

```txt
DeltaS_total(m) = w_early * DeltaS_early(m)
                  + w_late * DeltaS_late(m)
                  + w_cross * DeltaS_cross(m)
```

where the weights satisfy:

```txt
w_early  > 0
w_late   > 0
w_cross  > 0
w_early + w_late + w_cross = 1
```

To prevent trivial suppression of any component we also fix, at encoding design time, a lower bound

```txt
w_min in (0, 1/3]
```

and require

```txt
w_early  >= w_min
w_late   >= w_min
w_cross  >= w_min
```

These weights are common across all states and all worlds. They are not tuned per state, per data set, or per synthetic scenario.

The effective tension tensor is then defined as:

```txt
T_ij(m) = S_i(m) * C_j(m) * DeltaS_total(m) * lambda(m) * kappa
```

where:

* `S_i(m)` is a source like factor for the i th component that reflects how strongly that component participates in cosmology inference in state `m`.
* `C_j(m)` is a receptivity like factor for the j th component that reflects how sensitive it is to H0 related mismatch.
* `lambda(m)` is a convergence state factor that takes values in a fixed bounded interval and encodes whether local reasoning is convergent, recursive, divergent, or chaotic.
* `kappa` is a global coupling constant for the H0 consistency_tension encoding.

The index sets for `i` and `j` are left implicit. It is sufficient that for every regular state `m` the tensor entries are finite.

### 3.4 Invariants and effective constraints

We introduce two scalar invariants that are used in later blocks.

1. Cross probe H0 invariant

```txt
I_H0(m) = d_H0(m)
        = |H0_early(m) - H0_late(m)| /
          sqrt( Sigma_early(m)^2 + Sigma_late(m)^2 )
```

This invariant measures how many combined standard deviations separate the early and late H0 inferences encoded in `m`. It is dimensionless and nonnegative.

2. Multi scale consistency invariant

For a given world and a fixed encoding rule `enc` in `E_adm`, we consider the refinement sequence `m_enc(k)` and define:

```txt
I_scale(m_enc(k)) = DeltaS_total(m_enc(k))
```

The qualitative behaviour of `I_scale(m_enc(k))` as `k` increases encodes whether refinements of data and modelling:

* drive the total mismatch toward a low band,
* leave it roughly constant within a band,
* or keep it bounded away from zero.

### 3.5 Singular set and domain restrictions

Some observables may become undefined or unbounded. Examples include:

* uncertainty scales that vanish or become ill conditioned,
* effective H0 summaries that are not finite,
* baseline mismatch evaluations that fail.

We define the singular set:

```txt
S_sing = {
  m in M :
  Sigma_early(m) <= 0  or
  Sigma_late(m)  <= 0  or
  H0_early(m)    not in R  or
  H0_late(m)     not in R  or
  DeltaS_early(m) undefined or infinite  or
  DeltaS_late(m)  undefined or infinite  or
  DeltaS_cross(m) undefined or infinite
}
```

We restrict all H0 tension analysis to the regular set:

```txt
M_reg = M \ S_sing
```

If an experiment or protocol requires evaluating `DeltaS_total(m)` for a state `m` in `S_sing`, the result is treated as out of domain rather than as evidence about the underlying physics.

---

## 4. Tension principle for this problem

This block states how Q048 is characterised as a tension problem within TU at the effective layer.

### 4.1 Core H0 tension functional

We define the H0 tension functional as:

```txt
Tension_H0(m) = DeltaS_total(m)
```

for all `m` in `M_reg`. This choice satisfies:

* `Tension_H0(m) >= 0`,
* `Tension_H0(m) = 0` only when early, late, and cross probe mismatches all vanish within design tolerance,
* `Tension_H0(m)` increases whenever any component mismatch grows while the others are fixed.

Alternative monotone combinations of the component mismatches are allowed inside the same encoding class. They must be fixed before any world specific data are examined and they must preserve the basic monotonicity and vanishing properties described above.

### 4.2 Low tension principle

At the effective layer, the statement that a universe is well described by a single coherent expansion history that is compatible with the baseline modelling can be phrased as follows.

There exists:

* at least one encoding rule `enc` in `E_adm` that faithfully represents the world,
* a refinement sequence of regular states `{ m_enc(k) }_{k >= 0 }` in `M_reg` produced by this encoding,
* a small threshold `epsilon_H0 > 0`,
* and a minimum refinement level `k0 >= 0`,

such that for all `k >= k0`:

```txt
Tension_H0(m_enc(k)) <= epsilon_H0
```

The triple `(epsilon_H0, k0, enc_design)` is fixed at the level of encoding and experiment design. It is chosen based on expected achievable precision and modelling complexity, not by looking at the numerical H0 values of the actual world.

### 4.3 Persistent high tension principle

Conversely, if for a given world every admissible encoding that remains faithful to that world produces a tension functional that stays above a strictly positive threshold that does not vanish with refinement, we are in a persistent high tension regime.

Formally, there exists:

* a positive threshold `delta_H0 > 0`,
* and a minimum refinement level `k0 >= 0`,

such that for every encoding rule `enc` in `E_adm` that faithfully encodes the world and for all `k >= k0`:

```txt
Tension_H0(m_enc(k)) >= delta_H0
```

In this regime it is not possible to attribute the H0 tension to transient modelling issues that disappear with refinement inside the given model and encoding class. Any resolution would require at least one of the following:

* moving outside the baseline model class `B_base`,
* revising which probes are taken as trustworthy at high precision,
* discovering previously unknown correlations or systematics that fundamentally change the effective summaries.

As a BlackHole node, Q048 does not attempt to decide which regime applies in our universe. It only sets up a precise distinction between low tension and high tension regimes for an explicitly constrained family of encodings.

---

## 5. Counterfactual tension worlds

We now outline two counterfactual worlds described strictly at the effective layer:

* World T: H0 tension resolves under refinement inside the chosen model and encoding class.
* World F: H0 tension persists and indicates a deeper inconsistency inside those classes.

These worlds are described in terms of observable patterns, not hidden generative rules.

### 5.1 World T (tension resolves under refinement)

In World T:

1. Early and late H0 convergence

   * As `k` increases, there exists at least one admissible encoding rule `enc` and a corresponding sequence `m_T(k) = m_enc(k)` such that

     ```txt
     I_H0(m_T(k)) stays of order 1 or less
     ```

     and remains compatible with a shared H0, given the reported uncertainties.

2. Baseline mismatch control

   * `DeltaS_early(m_T(k))` and `DeltaS_late(m_T(k))` remain bounded and can be made small through reasonable modifications inside the chosen baseline model class, for example improved nuisance parameter treatment or calibration updates that remain within the original modelling scope.

3. Total tension band

   * There exists a design time threshold `epsilon_H0` such that for sufficiently large `k`:

     ```txt
     Tension_H0(m_T(k)) <= epsilon_H0
     ```

4. Interpretation inside the template

   * Within the World T template, the remaining differences between H0 analyses are interpreted as consequences of finite data, manageable systematics, and modest model extensions, not as signs of deep inconsistency.

### 5.2 World F (tension persists and indicates deeper inconsistency)

In World F:

1. Persistent cross probe mismatch

   * For every admissible encoding rule `enc` and the corresponding sequence `m_F(k) = m_enc(k)`, there exist `delta_H0 > 0` and `k0` such that for all `k >= k0`:

     ```txt
     I_H0(m_F(k)) >= delta_H0
     ```

     with `delta_H0` significantly larger than unity.

2. Baseline mismatch asymmetry

   * Attempts to adjust modelling within `B_base` cannot simultaneously keep both `DeltaS_early(m_F(k))` and `DeltaS_late(m_F(k))` inside their design tolerance bands. Reducing one inevitably increases the other beyond those bands.

3. Total tension floor

   * For all `k >= k0`:

     ```txt
     Tension_H0(m_F(k)) >= delta_H0'
     ```

     for some strictly positive `delta_H0'` that cannot be removed by refinements inside the admissible encoding class.

4. Interpretation inside the template

   * Within the World F template, the tension is interpreted as a sign that at least one of the following holds:

     * some widely used data sets are fundamentally mis calibrated,
     * the baseline model class is qualitatively inadequate,
     * or the joint use of these probes is logically inconsistent inside the assumed framework.

### 5.3 Interpretive note

These counterfactual worlds do not construct or modify raw cosmological data. They only assert that if certain patterns of effective observables hold under admissible encodings, then the world belongs to either a low tension or high tension regime in the sense defined by `Tension_H0`.

This document does not assert which regime our universe belongs to. That decision requires separate empirical and modelling work beyond the scope of this effective layer encoding.

---

## 6. Falsifiability and discriminating experiments

This block specifies experiments and protocols at the effective layer that can:

* test the coherence of the Q048 encoding,
* distinguish between different H0 tension models,
* provide evidence for or against particular parameter choices inside `E_adm`.

These experiments do not resolve the H0 tension by themselves. They can only falsify or support specific TU encodings related to Q048.

All thresholds and design choices mentioned below are fixed at the encoding and experiment design stage. They are not tuned retrospectively to make any particular world appear more or less consistent.

### Experiment 1: Multi probe tension mapping

Goal: test whether the `Tension_H0` functional produces stable and interpretable tension estimates when applied to real combinations of early and late universe probes.

Setup:

* Input data:

  * published likelihoods or summary statistics for early probes such as CMB and BAO,
  * published likelihoods or summary statistics for late probes such as distance ladder, strong lensing time delays, and standard sirens.

* Fixed in advance:

  * the baseline model class `B_base`,
  * the admissible encoding class `E_adm`,
  * the weight triple `(w_early, w_late, w_cross)` and the function `G`,
  * a discrete menu of probe combinations to be tested,
  * a tolerance band for acceptable variation in `Tension_H0` under small modelling changes.

Protocol:

1. For each chosen combination of probes, for example CMB only, CMB plus BAO, late only, and all probes, construct an effective state `m_data` in `M_reg` via an encoding rule in `E_adm`.

2. For each `m_data`, evaluate:

   * `H0_early(m_data)` and `H0_late(m_data)` where defined,
   * `Sigma_early(m_data)` and `Sigma_late(m_data)`,
   * `DeltaS_early(m_data)`, `DeltaS_late(m_data)` and `DeltaS_cross(m_data)`,
   * `Tension_H0(m_data)`.

3. Build a table or map of `Tension_H0(m_data)` values indexed by probe combinations.

4. Repeat the above steps for several reasonable modelling choices inside `B_base` that are considered part of the same modelling family, for example different but standard nuisance parameter treatments, to check robustness.

Metrics:

* The distribution of `Tension_H0(m_data)` across probe combinations,
* maximum and median `Tension_H0` values,
* sensitivity of `Tension_H0` to changes in:

  * inclusion or exclusion of specific probes from the predefined menu,
  * small and justified changes in nuisance parameter treatments.

Falsification conditions:

* If small, justified changes in modelling choices within `B_base` and `E_adm` that keep the underlying data and main assumptions fixed lead to changes in `Tension_H0(m_data)` that exceed the design time tolerance band or qualitatively invert which probe combinations appear high tension versus low tension, then the encoding is considered unstable and rejected.
* If `Tension_H0(m_data)` systematically classifies probe combinations that are known to be internally consistent as high tension, while classifying obviously contradictory synthetic combinations as low tension in controlled tests, then the encoding is considered misaligned with its intended interpretation and rejected.

Semantics implementation note: all quantities in this experiment are treated as continuous real valued summaries in line with the declared field type. No discrete or hybrid interpretation is introduced here.

Boundary note: falsifying a TU encoding does not solve the canonical H0 problem. This experiment can reject specific encodings of H0 tension, but it does not decide whether the H0 tension is mainly due to systematics, model extension, or new physics.

---

### Experiment 2: Synthetic universes with controlled H0 consistency

Goal: check whether the Q048 encoding can reliably distinguish between synthetic universes with consistent H0 across probes and synthetic universes with built in H0 inconsistency.

Setup:

* Build two families of simulated data sets.

  * Family C (consistent):

    * all probes are generated from a single “true” background cosmology with a fixed H0.

  * Family I (inconsistent):

    * early probes are generated from one cosmology and late probes from another, or late probes are mis calibrated so that their effective H0 differs by several sigma from the early value.

* For each simulated data set, construct an effective state in `M_reg` via an encoding in `E_adm`, using the same baseline model class `B_base` and the same encoding parameters as in Experiment 1.

Protocol:

1. For each simulated universe in Family C and Family I, build a state `m_C` or `m_I` in `M_reg` that captures early and late H0 summaries and uncertainties.

2. Evaluate `DeltaS_early`, `DeltaS_late`, `DeltaS_cross` and `Tension_H0` for each state.

3. For each refinement level or complexity setting considered, construct the empirical distributions:

   ```txt
   D_C = distribution of Tension_H0 over Family C
   D_I = distribution of Tension_H0 over Family I
   ```

4. Define a separation score `S_sep` for each design, for example:

   * the difference between the mean of `D_I` and the mean of `D_C`, or
   * a rank based measure such as the fraction of random pairs `(m_C, m_I)` for which `Tension_H0(m_I) > Tension_H0(m_C)`.

5. Optionally vary some encoding settings inside `E_adm` that are allowed at design time, without using information about which family each simulated universe belongs to, to check robustness of the separation.

Metrics:

* mean and variance of `Tension_H0` in Family C and Family I,
* the separation score `S_sep`,
* stability of `S_sep` under modest encoding variations inside `E_adm`.

Falsification conditions:

* At design time, fix a minimal acceptable separation threshold `S_sep_min`.
* If under reasonable encoding choices in `E_adm`, the separation score `S_sep` remains below `S_sep_min` for all tested configurations, then the encoding is considered ineffective for distinguishing consistent from inconsistent universes and is rejected.
* If the encoding assigns systematically lower `Tension_H0` values to Family I universes than to Family C universes in a majority of simulations, then the encoding is misaligned with its intended meaning and is rejected.
* The membership of a simulated universe in Family C or Family I is determined solely by its generation mechanism, not by its `Tension_H0` value. Using tension values to define families would violate the fairness requirements of the encoding and is not permitted.

Semantics implementation note: the simulated observables are treated as continuous real valued summaries that use the same interpretation and field type as in the real data experiment. No additional structure is introduced.

Boundary note: falsifying or passing this synthetic test only evaluates the quality of the encoding and its robustness. It does not determine the true origin of the H0 tension in our universe.

## 7. AI and WFGY engineering spec

This block describes how Q048 can be used as an engineering module for AI systems inside WFGY style architectures, at the effective layer.

### 7.1 Training signals

We define several training signals that can be used in AI models to encourage tension aware cosmology reasoning.

1. `signal_H0_consistency`

   * Definition: a penalty proportional to `I_H0(m)` when the model’s internal representation implies different H0 values for early and late probes in a scenario where a shared H0 is assumed.
   * Purpose: discourage internal reasoning that implicitly treats early and late probes as referring to incompatible expansion histories when the context assumes a single H0.

2. `signal_multi_probe_stability`

   * Definition: a signal that penalises large changes in `Tension_H0(m)` across small, controlled changes in probe sets or nuisance parameter treatments in specially designed test suites.
   * Purpose: encourage the model to develop representations where conclusions about H0 consistency are robust under modest, justified changes in modelling choices.

3. `signal_tension_explanation_quality`

   * Definition: a composite signal derived from whether the model, when asked to explain the H0 tension:

     * correctly identifies which probes are in disagreement,
     * separates narratives about systematics from narratives about new physics,
     * avoids collapsing everything into a single averaged H0 value without discussing tension.

   * Purpose: push the model toward structured, transparent explanations of H0 tension.

4. `signal_counterfactual_H0_worlds`

   * Definition: a signal based on the difference between answers given under explicit World T and World F assumptions in prompts, measured by consistency with their respective definitions in Block 5.
   * Purpose: encourage the model to keep distinct world assumptions separate instead of mixing them.

All these signals are defined at the effective layer. They do not require access to any TU bottom layer machinery.

### 7.2 Architectural patterns

We outline module patterns that reuse Q048 structures while remaining at the effective layer.

1. `H0ConsistencyHead`

   * Role: given an internal representation of a cosmology related context, outputs:

     * an estimate of `Tension_H0(m)`,
     * a small vector of components that mirror `DeltaS_early`, `DeltaS_late` and `DeltaS_cross`.

   * Interface:

     * Input: internal embedding of a conversation or document about cosmology,
     * Output: scalar tension estimate plus component wise contributions.

   * Use: serves as an auxiliary head for both training and introspection.

2. `MultiProbeAggregator`

   * Role: aggregates partial evidence about H0 from different probes into a unified internal state that is suitable for tension evaluation.

   * Interface:

     * Input: probe specific embeddings, for example “CMB analysis”, “distance ladder result”, “standard siren constraint”,
     * Output: a unified representation that can be fed to `H0ConsistencyHead`.

   * Use: encourages the model to keep track of which inference came from which probe and to avoid mixing them in an uncontrolled way.

3. `TU_CosmoObserver_H0`

   * Role: a specialised observer module that extracts:

     * implied H0 values,
     * uncertainty scales,
     * qualitative statements about tension,

     from the model’s internal representations when prompted.

   * Interface:

     * Input: internal state plus an instruction such as “observe H0 related quantities”,
     * Output: a structured record that contains effective H0 summaries and tension estimates.

   * Use: provides an interpretable layer where tension related quantities can be inspected without exposing TU internals.

### 7.3 Evaluation harness

We suggest an evaluation harness for models that are augmented with Q048 modules.

1. Task design

   * Build a test suite of questions and prompts that:

     * describe different H0 measurements and their uncertainties,
     * ask whether those measurements are mutually consistent,
     * request explanations of possible resolutions or interpretations.

2. Conditions

   * Baseline condition:

     * the model answers without explicit Q048 modules.

   * TU enhanced condition:

     * the same base model but with `H0ConsistencyHead`, `MultiProbeAggregator` and the training signals from Section 7.1 active or used during training.

3. Metrics

   * Accuracy on factual questions about the existence and qualitative magnitude of H0 tension,
   * consistency of implied H0 values across prompts that refer to the same data,
   * quality of explanations, ranked by independent evaluators with a rubric that values:

     * clear separation of probes,
     * explicit mention of uncertainties,
     * correct recognition that tension may or may not point to new physics.

### 7.4 60 second reproduction protocol

A minimal protocol for external users to experience the impact of the Q048 encoding.

* Baseline setup:

  * Prompt: ask the model to “Explain how different measurements of the Hubble constant compare, and whether there is any problem or tension.”
  * Observation: note whether the answer conflates probes, merely reports a range of values, or incorrectly states that there is no known issue.

* TU encoded setup:

  * Prompt: ask the same question but add the instruction to “organise the explanation around cross probe tension for H0, distinguishing early universe measurements from late universe measurements, and describe what it would mean for the tension to resolve or to persist.”
  * Observation: note whether the answer explicitly distinguishes probe families, introduces a consistent notion of tension, and frames possible resolutions in a structured way.

* Comparison metric:

  * use a simple three point scale to rate:

    * clarity of which probes disagree,
    * explicitness of the tension concept,
    * balance between systematics and new physics narratives.

  * compare baseline and TU enhanced answers according to this scale.

* What to log:

  * prompts and full responses for both setups,
  * any auxiliary tension estimates from Q048 modules that are exposed.

These logs can later be used to audit how the model handles high profile consistency problems.

## 8. Cross problem transfer template

This block describes reusable components produced by Q048 and how they transfer to other problems, while remaining at the effective layer.

### 8.1 Reusable components produced by this problem

1. ComponentName: `H0_TensionFunctional`

   * Type: functional

   * Minimal interface:

     * Inputs:

       * `H0_early_summary`,
       * `H0_late_summary`,
       * `Sigma_early_summary`,
       * `Sigma_late_summary`,
       * baseline mismatch indicators for early and late probes.

     * Output:

       * `tension_value` in the nonnegative real numbers.

   * Preconditions:

     * inputs refer to a single world and a single baseline model class,
     * uncertainty scales are strictly positive.

2. ComponentName: `MultiProbeCosmoState`

   * Type: field

   * Minimal interface:

     * Inputs:

       * a list of probe summaries, including at least one early and one late probe,
       * a description of the shared model class and nuisance parameter treatment.

     * Output:

       * an internal representation that is sufficient for evaluating `H0_TensionFunctional`.

   * Preconditions:

     * summaries are mutually compatible in the sense that they can be modelled inside one coherent cosmology.

3. ComponentName: `CosmoTensionExperimentPattern_H0`

   * Type: experiment_pattern

   * Minimal interface:

     * Inputs:

       * a choice of real or synthetic data sets that involve early and late H0 probes,
       * encoding parameters inside `E_adm`.

     * Output:

       * a set of experiment descriptions that follow the template in Block 6.

   * Preconditions:

     * data sets are labelled by probe type and accompanied by uncertainty information.

All three components stay at the effective layer. They do not expose any TU bottom layer machinery.

### 8.2 Direct reuse targets

1. Q041 (dark matter content and clustering)

   * Reused component: `MultiProbeCosmoState`.
   * Why it transfers: dark matter constraints often mix probes that also constrain H0. The same state structure can hold combined information about matter density and expansion rate.
   * What changes: additional fields are added to the state to represent dark matter related observables and the tension functional is extended to include them.

2. Q042 (dark energy equation of state)

   * Reused component: `H0_TensionFunctional`.
   * Why it transfers: dark energy studies often examine whether changes in the equation of state can reconcile early and late H0 measurements. The H0 tension functional provides a scalar objective to track while scanning model extensions.
   * What changes: inputs include extra parameters that describe the equation of state and the interpretation of baseline mismatch shifts from pure LCDM to an extended model.

3. Q050 (multiverse and landscape cosmology)

   * Reused component: `CosmoTensionExperimentPattern_H0`.
   * Why it transfers: in multiverse scenarios one can imagine ensembles of universes with different H0 values and probe mixes. The experiment pattern gives a template for asking how likely a given universe with a certain level of H0 tension would be under those ensembles.
   * What changes: data sets and priors are taken over multiple hypothetical universes instead of a single realised universe.

4. Q121 (AI alignment in scientific contexts)

   * Reused component: `H0_TensionFunctional` as an example of an “inference tension” functional.
   * Why it transfers: aligned AI systems must detect when different sources of evidence about the same quantity disagree at a high level. The H0 case provides a concrete calibration example for that behaviour.
   * What changes: the quantity of interest is generalised from H0 to arbitrary scalar scientific parameters.

In all of these reuse cases, only effective layer structures are imported. No TU bottom layer rules are implied or shared by this transfer.

## 9. TU roadmap and verification levels

This block explains how Q048 is positioned along the TU verification ladder and what the next measurable steps are.

### 9.1 Current levels

* E_level: E1

  * a coherent effective encoding of H0 tension has been specified:

    * state space and observables,
    * aggregate tension functional,
    * singular set and domain restrictions,
    * at least two explicit experiment patterns with falsification conditions for encodings in `E_adm`.

* N_level: N2

  * the narrative that links early and late probes, tension functionals, and counterfactual worlds is explicit and internally coherent,
  * reuse paths to other cosmology and AI problems are identified at the effective layer.

### 9.2 Next measurable step toward E2

To move from E1 to E2, at least one of the following should be implemented.

1. A practical tool that:

   * takes as input published H0 related probe summaries,
   * constructs states in `M_reg` under a specified encoding rule from `E_adm`,
   * computes `Tension_H0` and publishes the resulting tension maps as open data together with encoding choices.

2. A synthetic benchmark where:

   * families of consistent and inconsistent universes as in Experiment 2 are constructed,
   * the separation performance of different encoding choices is systematically evaluated,
   * results are documented in a way that allows independent reproduction.

Both steps operate entirely on observable summaries and encoding parameters. They do not reveal any TU bottom layer generative rules.

### 9.3 Long term role in the TU program

In the long run, Q048 is expected to serve as:

* a canonical example of cross experiment tension in a mature physical science,
* a calibration case for more general consistency_tension nodes in the BlackHole graph,
* a link between cosmology, information theory and AI alignment, which shows how careful handling of inferential tension can prevent premature averaging or oversimplified conclusions.

## 10. Elementary but precise explanation

This block gives an explanation suitable for non specialists while staying aligned with the effective layer description.

The Hubble constant, written as H0, describes how fast the universe is expanding today. There are several ways to measure it.

* One method looks at the afterglow of the Big Bang, the cosmic microwave background, and fits a model of the early universe.
* Another method builds a distance ladder in the nearby universe, using objects such as Cepheid stars and supernovae.
* There are also other methods, such as gravitational lensing and gravitational wave standard sirens.

Ideally, all these methods should agree on the same value for H0, within their quoted uncertainties, if our basic picture of the universe is correct and all known systematics are under control. At the moment they do not fully agree. This is what people call the H0 tension.

In the Tension Universe view, we do not assume any specific method is right or wrong. Instead, we ask questions like:

* can we define a number that tells us how badly different methods disagree,
* does this number get smaller when we improve our data and modelling, or does it stay large.

To do this, we imagine states that summarise, in one place:

* what the early universe measurements say about H0,
* what the late universe measurements say about H0,
* how uncertain each of these is,
* how well they fit a baseline cosmological model.

We then define a tension score which:

* is small when early and late H0 agree within their uncertainties and both fit the baseline model,
* is large when they do not.

We also imagine two kinds of hypothetical worlds.

* In one kind, as we improve our measurements and models, the tension score settles down to a small value. Then the tension can be seen as a temporary issue caused by imperfect data and modelling.
* In the other kind, no matter how we refine things inside the agreed model class, the tension score stays large. That would suggest that something more fundamental is wrong with our assumptions or that new physics is needed.

This way of looking at the problem does not solve the H0 tension. It does not tell us which data sets to trust or which physical explanation is correct. What it provides is:

* a clear and quantitative way to talk about how serious the tension is,
* a framework for testing whether particular ways of encoding the data make sense,
* a set of reusable tools that can be applied to other situations where different lines of evidence about the same quantity do not agree.

Q048 collects this structure for the Hubble constant tension and connects it to other cosmology questions and to the design of AI systems that reason about scientific evidence. All of this remains inside the effective layer of Tension Universe and does not assert any final verdict about our real universe.

## Tension Universe effective layer footer

This page is part of the WFGY / Tension Universe S problem collection.

### Scope of claims

* The goal of this document is to specify an effective layer encoding of the named problem.
* It does not claim to prove or disprove the canonical statement in Section 1.
* It does not introduce any new theorem beyond what is already established in the cited literature.
* It should not be cited as evidence that the corresponding open problem in mathematics, physics, cosmology or AI has been solved.

### Effective layer boundary

* All objects used here, such as state spaces `M`, observables, invariants, tension scores, counterfactual worlds and experiment patterns, live purely at the effective layer of the TU framework.
* No TU bottom layer axioms, generating rules, or internal constructions are exposed or assumed known by the reader.
* No explicit mapping from raw data or simulations into TU internal fields is given. Only the existence of such mappings, compatible with the effective layer structure, is assumed.
* Any concrete implementation that computes quantities defined here must supply its own data pipelines and numerical methods. Those implementations may be falsified by experiments without affecting the formal status of this page.

### Relation to other TU documents

* This page should be read together with the following charters:

  * [TU Effective Layer Charter](../Charters/TU_EFFECTIVE_LAYER_CHARTER.md)
  * [TU Encoding and Fairness Charter](../Charters/TU_ENCODING_AND_FAIRNESS_CHARTER.md)
  * [TU Tension Scale Charter](../Charters/TU_TENSION_SCALE_CHARTER.md)
  * [TU Global Guardrails](../Charters/TU_GLOBAL_GUARDRAILS.md)

These charters specify the shared rules for effective layer encodings, fairness constraints on encodings and experiments, and the interpretation of tension scales that are used across the Tension Universe program.

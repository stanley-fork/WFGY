## 0. Effective layer disclaimer

All statements in this document are made strictly at the **effective layer** of the Tension Universe (TU) framework.

* We work entirely with **discrete state spaces**, observables, mismatch functionals, tension functionals, and falsifiability experiments.
* We do **not** define or expose any TU deep generative rules, any underlying field equations, or any construction of internal TU objects from raw data.
* We **do not** modify the standard definitions of complexity classes such as `P`, `BPP`, `NP`, `BQP`, `PP`, `PSPACE`, or `PH`.
* We **do not** state or assume any theorem of the form
  `P = BQP`, `P ⊊ BQP`, `BQP ⊊ PH`, or similar class separations or equalities.
* Whenever we talk about candidate problems that are “in `BQP` but not in `P`” we are referring to **community beliefs and conjectural status**, never to definitions. These labels live inside a reference profile that can be audited and challenged.
* All counterfactual “World T / World F” scenarios in this file are defined purely as patterns of **observables and tension scores**. They are not claims about which world is actual.
* Experiments in this file can **falsify particular encodings or parameter choices**. They cannot solve the underlying complexity questions or decide the true relationship between `P` and `BQP`.

Everything below must be read under this disclaimer and together with the TU charters linked in the footer.

## 1. Canonical problem and status

### 1.1 Canonical statement

We fix standard discrete models of computation:

* Deterministic and probabilistic Turing machines.
* Uniform families of quantum circuits and quantum Turing machines with bounded error.

Definitions.

* `P` is the class of all decision problems that can be solved by a deterministic Turing machine in time bounded by a polynomial in the input length `n`.

* `BQP` is the class of all decision problems that can be solved by a uniform family of quantum circuits (or by a quantum Turing machine) in time polynomial in `n`, with two sided error probability at most `1/3` on every input. By standard amplification the constant `1/3` can be replaced by any fixed constant less than `1/2`.

The core complexity class question is:

> How does `P` compare with `BQP` as sets of decision problems?

The standard crisp possibilities are:

1. `P = BQP`.
2. `P` is a proper subset of `BQP`, so there are problems that can be solved efficiently by quantum computers but not by any classical deterministic polynomial time algorithm.

Beyond this, there are refined structural questions.

* Whether specific natural problems, such as **integer factoring** or **discrete logarithm**, lie in `P`, in `BQP`, in both, or in neither.
* How `BQP` sits inside larger classes such as `PP`, `PSPACE`, or the polynomial time hierarchy `PH`.
* How candidate **quantum speedups** interact with randomized classes like `BPP`.

In this Q052 entry we do not attempt to prove or refute any class equality or separation. Instead we encode how different positions of `BQP` relative to `P` and related classes show up as **low tension** or **high tension** regimes inside the TU effective layer.

### 1.2 Status and difficulty

Some standard facts.

* The relationship between `P` and `BQP` is **unknown**. It is not known whether `P = BQP` or `P` is strictly contained in `BQP`.

* Current inclusions:

  * `P ⊆ BPP ⊆ BQP ⊆ PP ⊆ PSPACE ⊆ EXP`.
  * The inclusions on this line are all known or standard.

* There are strong candidate problems believed to be in `BQP` but not in `P`, such as:

  * Integer factoring and discrete logarithm, which admit efficient quantum algorithms (for example Shor type algorithms) but have no known deterministic classical polynomial time algorithms.
  * Certain hidden subgroup problems where quantum algorithms give exponential improvements over all known classical methods for the same group families.

* Oracle and relativized results show that in some artificial worlds:

  * `BQP^A` can escape the polynomial hierarchy `PH^A`.
  * In other relativized worlds, `BQP^A` behaves closer to classical classes, suggesting that diagonalization or simple relativizing techniques are unlikely to resolve `P` versus `BQP` in the unrelativized world.

The informal consensus in the complexity community is that quantum computers provide **genuine superpolynomial speedups** on at least some natural problems. So it is widely believed that `P` is a proper subset of `BQP`. This belief rests on a combination of structural results, heuristic arguments, and the apparent difficulty of improving classical algorithms, not on a theorem.

The question sits at the intersection of:

* Complexity theory,
* Quantum information and quantum error correction,
* Physics and thermodynamics of computation,

and is considered extremely hard. It participates in the broader unresolved structure of `P`, `BPP`, `NP`, `BQP`, `PP`, `PH`, and related classes.

### 1.3 Role in the BlackHole project

Within the **BlackHole S problem collection**, Q052 has three main roles.

1. It is the primary node for **computational_tension between classical and quantum efficient computation**. It measures how costly it is to maintain a picture of computation where quantum computers are either “just classical in disguise” or “genuinely more powerful”.

2. It provides a structured way to talk about **quantum advantage** as a tension observable, instead of as a slogan. The advantage is encoded as explicit mismatch functionals and resource profiles, not as vague claims that “quantum computers are faster”.

3. It supplies reusable components and templates for other problems where the presence or absence of quantum speedups changes what is feasible, including:

   * Thermodynamic cost of computation.
   * AI alignment protocols that rely on specific complexity assumptions.
   * Interpretability schemes for AI systems that might themselves exploit quantum resources.

## 2. Position in the BlackHole graph

This block records how Q052 connects to other S problems Q001 to Q125. Each edge has a short reason in terms of concrete components or tension types.

### 2.1 Upstream problems

These provide prerequisites and tools at the effective layer.

* **Q051 (BH_CS_PVNP_L3_051)**
  Reason: Supplies the baseline structure for classical deterministic complexity and the P versus NP tension. Q052 extends that structure to quantum resources, reusing notions of gap functionals and computational_tension.

* **Q059 (BH_CS_INFO_THERMODYN_L3_059)**
  Reason: Provides information theoretic and thermodynamic cost notions that Q052 reuses when defining resource based mismatches like `DeltaS_resource`.

* **Q032 (BH_PHYS_QTHERMO_L3_032)**
  Reason: Encodes physical limits on quantum coherence, error correction, and energy cost which constrain the admissible resource profiles that Q052 is allowed to treat as “physically plausible”.

### 2.2 Downstream problems

These problems directly reuse Q052 components or depend on its computational_tension structure.

* **Q056 (BH_CS_CIRCUIT_LOWER_L3_056)**
  Reason: Reuses `ComplexityLandscape_Field` and `QuantumAdvantage_TensionScore` when formulating circuit lower bound tension that depends on the existence or absence of quantum improvements.

* **Q121 (BH_AI_ALIGNMENT_L3_121)**
  Reason: Uses `OracleWorld_Complexity_Template` to model how access to quantum computation shifts the feasible space of AI alignment schemes.

* **Q123 (BH_AI_INTERP_L3_123)**
  Reason: Reuses Q052 tension components to test how interpretability tools behave under different assumptions about what is efficiently computable classically and quantumly.

### 2.3 Parallel problems

These share similar tension types but do not depend directly on Q052.

* **Q053 (BH_CS_ONEWAYFUNC_L3_053)**
  Reason: Also studies computational_tension, in that case between easy forward computation and hard inversion. It focuses on one way functions rather than on quantum advantage, but both problems measure a gap between two directions of a process.

* **Q055 (BH_CS_GI_COMPLEXITY_L3_055)**
  Reason: Deals with graph isomorphism complexity, where potential quantum speedups are relevant, but Q055 does not need the full P versus BQP tension machinery as its primary axis.

### 2.4 Cross domain edges

These connect Q052 to nodes in other domains via shared components.

* **Q032 (BH_PHYS_QTHERMO_L3_032)**
  Reason: Shares resource and noise observables. Q032 constrains which `Resource_limit(k)` profiles are admissible for Q052.

* **Q031 (BH_PHYS_QINFO_L3_031)**
  Reason: Reuses `ComplexityLandscape_Field` to interpret limits of quantum information processing as constraints on feasible positions of `BQP` relative to other classes.

* **Q059 (BH_CS_INFO_THERMODYN_L3_059)**
  Reason: Uses `QuantumAdvantage_TensionScore` to relate complexity based advantage to thermodynamic cost, tying quantum advantage to heat, entropy, and energy usage.

## 3. Tension Universe encoding (effective layer)

All content in this block is at the effective layer. We specify:

* Discrete state spaces,
* Observables and fields,
* Mismatch functionals,
* Tension functionals and singular sets.

We do **not** describe how any of these objects are produced from deep TU dynamics or from raw data.

### 3.1 State space

We assume a discrete semantic state space

```txt
M_Q052
```

Each state `m` in `M_Q052` represents a coherent **complexity landscape configuration** for classical and quantum computation at some finite resolution.

For each `m` we assume, at the effective layer, that:

* It encodes a finite set `L_set(m)` of decision or promise problems under consideration.

* For each `L` in `L_set(m)` and for each resolution scale `k` in a finite set `K_Q052`, it encodes coarse complexity assessments, such as:

  * A classical cost estimate `Time_class(m; L, k)`.
  * A quantum cost estimate `Time_quantum(m; L, k)`.

* It encodes resource summaries such as:

  * Maximum allowed time exponents for classical and quantum algorithms at scale `k`.
  * Maximum circuit depth and width for classical and quantum circuits.
  * Coarse noise and error parameters that matter for quantum algorithms.

We do not specify how real machines, algorithms, proofs, or hardware measurements are compressed into such states. At the effective layer we only assume that:

* Each state `m` carries a **finite**, internally consistent summary of these quantities.
* The set `K_Q052` of resolution scales is the same for all states, fixed once at the level of this encoding key.

### 3.2 Observables and fields

On the state space `M_Q052` we define the following discrete observables.

1. **Classical feasibility indicator**

```txt
C_class(m; L, k) in {0, 1}
```

* `C_class(m; L, k) = 1` means that in configuration `m`, problem `L` is treated as **classically feasible** at resolution scale `k`. For example there is a known or assumed deterministic algorithm with cost within the allowed classical resource band at that scale.
* `C_class(m; L, k) = 0` means it is not treated as classically feasible at that scale.

2. **Quantum feasibility indicator**

```txt
C_quantum(m; L, k) in {0, 1}
```

* `C_quantum(m; L, k) = 1` means that in configuration `m`, problem `L` is treated as **quantum feasible** at scale `k`, for example placed in `BQP` at that resolution with acceptable error probability.
* `C_quantum(m; L, k) = 0` means it is not treated as quantum feasible at that scale.

3. **Advantage profile**

```txt
Gap_advantage(m; L, k) >= 0
```

A nonnegative quantity that summarizes the difference between classical and quantum costs at scale `k`. A simple example is an exponent gap:

```txt
Gap_advantage(m; L, k) =
  max(0, Exp_class(m; L, k) - Exp_quantum(m; L, k))
```

where `Exp_class` and `Exp_quantum` are effective exponents in polynomial or quasi polynomial bounds extracted from `Time_class` and `Time_quantum`.

4. **Resource profile observables**

```txt
Noise_budget(m; k)   >= 0
Error_tolerance(m; k)>= 0
Resource_use(m; k)   >= 0
```

* `Noise_budget` and `Error_tolerance` summarize what levels of quantum noise and error are considered acceptable at scale `k`.
* `Resource_use(m; k)` is an effective measure of how much quantum hardware and error correction the algorithms in state `m` require at scale `k`.

These observables are purely discrete summaries, consistent with the `Semantics: discrete` metadata.

### 3.3 Admissible encoding class and reference profiles

To avoid hidden tuning that forces desired outcomes, we define a class of **admissible encodings** for Q052.

1. **Reference classification**

We fix once and for all a reference classification

```txt
C_ref(L, k)
Q_ref(L, k)
```

satisfying:

* `C_ref(L, k) in {0, 1}` and `Q_ref(L, k) in {0, 1}`.
* `C_ref` and `Q_ref` are based only on:

  * Standard textbook definitions of `P`, `BPP`, `NP`, `BQP`, and related classes.
  * Published complexity results that have explicit proofs.
  * A clearly documented list of **conjectural labels** (for example, that factoring is “treated as in BQP and not known to be in P”) that can be audited separately.

The reference profiles do **not** build in any theorem about `P` versus `BQP`. In particular:

* When we mark a problem as “in `BQP` but not in `P`” at some scale, this means
  “currently believed to be efficiently solvable by quantum algorithms and not known to be in `P`”.
  It is a belief flag, not a definition.

The choice of `C_ref`, `Q_ref`, and the list of conjectural labels is fixed at the level of **encoding key** `ENC_PVBQP_DISCRETE_V1`. It is not changed per experiment, per state, or per result.

2. **Admissible encodings**

An encoding for Q052 is **admissible** if and only if:

* There exists a fixed choice of reference profiles `C_ref`, `Q_ref`, resolution scales `K_Q052`, and weights (defined below) such that, for all states `m` and all `(L, k)`:

  ```txt
  C_class(m; L, k) in { C_ref(L, k), 0 }
  C_quantum(m; L, k) in { Q_ref(L, k), 0 }
  ```

  where any deviation from the reference profile (the choice `0`) is explicitly documented as “unknown” or “not encoded”, never as a hidden redefinition.

* The set of scales `K_Q052 = {k_min, ..., k_max}` is finite, fixed, and shared across all states and all experiments for this encoding key.

* There exist fixed nonnegative weights `w_comp`, `w_res` with:

  ```txt
  w_comp > 0
  w_res  > 0
  w_comp + w_res = 1
  ```

  chosen once for this encoding key and never tuned post hoc.

* There exists a fixed family of nonnegative weights `w_Lk` over `(L, k)` pairs and `v_k` over scales `k`, with total mass at most 1 in each case. These weights are part of the encoding specification and do not depend on experiment outcomes.

Any encoding that attempts to adjust `C_ref`, `Q_ref`, `K_Q052`, `w_comp`, `w_res`, `w_Lk`, or `v_k` in response to experimental results is considered **non admissible** and outside the scope of Q052.

### 3.4 Mismatch observables

Given an admissible encoding, we define two mismatch observables.

1. **Complexity classification mismatch**

```txt
DeltaS_comp(m) >= 0
```

This measures how far configuration `m` deviates from the fixed reference classification. A simple effective form is:

```txt
DeltaS_comp(m) =
  sum over L in L_set(m), k in K_Q052 of
    w_Lk * mismatch(m; L, k)
```

where:

```txt
mismatch(m; L, k) =
  |C_class(m; L, k)   - C_ref(L, k)| +
  |C_quantum(m; L, k) - Q_ref(L, k)|
```

with `w_Lk` as above. If a state consistently reclassifies problems in ways that contradict `C_ref`, the complexity mismatch grows.

2. **Resource feasibility mismatch**

```txt
DeltaS_resource(m) >= 0
```

This captures how aggressively configuration `m` uses quantum resources relative to fixed physical and informational limits.

We define:

```txt
DeltaS_resource(m) =
  sum over k in K_Q052 of
    v_k * overload(m; k)
```

where:

```txt
overload(m; k) =
  max(0, Resource_use(m; k) - Resource_limit(k))
```

and:

* `Resource_limit(k)` is a fixed bound determined by the effective layer encodings of Q032 and Q059 under specified version or hash,
* `Resource_use(m; k)` is an effective summary of the quantum resources that state `m` assumes at scale `k`,
* `v_k` are fixed weights as above.

The mapping from Q032 / Q059 into the `Resource_limit(k)` family is part of the encoding key `ENC_PVBQP_DISCRETE_V1`. It is specified once and must be logged in experiments so that external auditors can check how physical constraints are being imported.

### 3.5 Combined Q052 mismatch and tension tensor

We combine the mismatches into:

```txt
DeltaS_Q052(m) =
  w_comp * DeltaS_comp(m) +
  w_res  * DeltaS_resource(m)
```

with `w_comp`, `w_res` defined at the encoding level. By construction:

```txt
DeltaS_Q052(m) >= 0
```

for every state where component mismatches are finite.

We then define an effective tension tensor:

```txt
T_ij_Q052(m) =
  S_i(m) * C_j(m) * DeltaS_Q052(m) * lambda(m) * kappa_Q052
```

where:

* `S_i(m)` is a source factor describing how strong the claims about quantum advantage and complexity structure are in this configuration.
* `C_j(m)` is a receptivity factor describing how sensitive a downstream system, observer, or protocol is to misclassification of classical vs quantum feasibility.
* `lambda(m)` is a TU convergence state factor taking values in a fixed interval, indicating whether the reasoning system is convergent, recursive, divergent, or chaotic.
* `kappa_Q052` is a fixed coupling constant that sets the overall scale of Q052 computational_tension.

The precise index sets for `i` and `j` are not needed at the effective layer. It is enough that for each `m` in the regular domain (defined next), `T_ij_Q052(m)` is finite whenever `DeltaS_Q052(m)` is finite.

### 3.6 Singular set and domain restriction

The singular set for Q052 is:

```txt
S_sing_Q052 =
  { m in M_Q052 :
    DeltaS_Q052(m) is undefined or not finite }
```

For example this includes states where:

* Required reference data is missing,
* Resource profiles violate basic consistency with Q032 / Q059,
* Or observables are not defined at all for some required `(L, k)`.

All tension analysis for Q052 is restricted to the **regular set**:

```txt
M_reg_Q052 = M_Q052 \ S_sing_Q052
```

Any attempt to evaluate `DeltaS_Q052(m)` or `Tension_Q052(m)` for `m` in `S_sing_Q052` is treated as **out of domain**. This is not evidence for or against any position about `P` vs `BQP`. It only indicates that the encoding does not apply to that configuration.

---

## 4. Tension principle for this problem

This block states the tension principle that characterizes Q052.

### 4.1 Core Q052 tension functional

We define a Q052 tension functional

```txt
Tension_Q052(m) =
  F_Q052(DeltaS_comp(m), DeltaS_resource(m))
```

for `m` in `M_reg_Q052`, where `F_Q052` is a fixed function satisfying:

* `F_Q052(x, y) >= 0` for all `x, y >= 0`,
* `F_Q052` is nondecreasing in each argument,
* `F_Q052(0, 0) = 0`.

A simple admissible choice is:

```txt
Tension_Q052(m) =
  a_comp * DeltaS_comp(m) +
  a_res  * DeltaS_resource(m)
```

with fixed coefficients `a_comp > 0`, `a_res > 0` that are part of the encoding key and do not depend on `m` or any experiment.

Informal reading:

* `DeltaS_comp(m)` measures how much the configuration is fighting against the reference complexity structure.
* `DeltaS_resource(m)` measures how much the configuration is stretching physical resource limits.
* `Tension_Q052(m)` measures the combined stress that arises when we try to maintain a particular story about the role of quantum computers under these constraints.

### 4.2 Low tension regime (conservative role for quantum computers)

In a low tension regime, quantum computers do not force large structural changes relative to classical efficient computation at the scales considered.

We express this pattern as:

* For world representing states `m_T` in `M_reg_Q052` that honestly encode the current complexity landscape,

  ```txt
  DeltaS_comp(m_T)    remains small and stable
  DeltaS_resource(m_T)remains bounded and moderate
  Tension_Q052(m_T)   <= epsilon_Q052
  ```

  for some small constant `epsilon_Q052` that can be chosen once for this encoding key.

* Candidate quantum advantages are either:

  * Matched by comparable classical algorithms at similar resource scales, or
  * Confined to regimes where resource mismatch is negligible at the chosen resolution.

In this regime quantum computers may give constant factor or low degree polynomial improvements, but they do not force us to treat large classes of problems as “structurally new” in terms of efficient solvability.

### 4.3 High tension regime (robust quantum advantage)

In a high tension regime, quantum computers provide **robust quantum advantage** on some natural problem families.

We express this as:

* There exist families of problems `L_k` in `L_set(m_F)` such that, at increasing scales `k`,

  ```txt
  Gap_advantage(m_F; L_k, k)  grows with k
  C_quantum(m_F; L_k, k)      = 1
  C_class(m_F; L_k, k)        = 0
  ```

  in a way that cannot be removed without either:

  * denying well established quantum algorithms, or
  * severely contradicting the reference profiles `C_ref`, `Q_ref`.

* For world representing states `m_F` in `M_reg_Q052` we have

  ```txt
  DeltaS_comp(m_F)    cannot be kept small
  DeltaS_resource(m_F)remains within realistic limits
  Tension_Q052(m_F)   >= delta_Q052
  ```

  for some strictly positive `delta_Q052` that is independent of minor changes in portfolios and scales.

This regime expresses the idea that quantum advantage is both **structural** (it survives reasonable changes in assumptions) and **physically meaningful** (it uses resources within the Q032 / Q059 limits).

### 4.4 Refinement and scale consistency

We order the resolution scales in `K_Q052` so that larger `k` corresponds to finer distinctions in cost and resource.

We require the following two consistency properties.

* **Low tension worlds.**
  In a world where quantum computers ultimately do not change the structure of efficient computation, there should exist a sequence of world states `m_T(k)` at increasing scales with:

  ```txt
  Tension_Q052(m_T(k)) <= epsilon_Q052
  ```

  for all sufficiently large `k`, using the same admissible encoding.

* **High tension worlds.**
  In a world where robust quantum advantage exists, any honest sequence `m_F(k)` that tracks growing scales must eventually satisfy:

  ```txt
  Tension_Q052(m_F(k)) >= delta_Q052
  ```

  for some fixed `delta_Q052 > 0`.

These requirements prevent trivial solutions where quantum advantage is erased simply by choosing extremely coarse scales or by silently changing the encoding when tension becomes inconvenient.

---

## 5. Counterfactual tension worlds

We outline two counterfactual “world patterns” for Q052. They are defined purely in terms of observables and tension scores under an admissible encoding.

### 5.1 World T: P and BQP effectively coincide

World T represents a scenario where quantum computers do not give strong structural advantages over classical computation, at least within the scales and portfolios considered.

Effective layer properties:

1. **Classification alignment**

   ```txt
   DeltaS_comp(m_T) is small
   ```

   for all world representing states `m_T`. The complexity landscape described by `m_T` stays close to the reference classification `C_ref`, `Q_ref`. Problems treated as quantum feasible but not classically feasible remain rare or marginal.

2. **Resource moderation**

   ```txt
   DeltaS_resource(m_T) is small
   ```

   because the resource use for candidate quantum algorithms stays close to the physical limits imported from Q032 / Q059. There is no systematic pattern of requiring unrealistic hardware just to rescue small theoretical speedups.

3. **Stabilized tension**

   ```txt
   Tension_Q052(m_T) <= epsilon_Q052
   ```

   across scales in `K_Q052`. As proofs and experiments accumulate, this band tends to tighten rather than drift upward.

This world pattern corresponds roughly to a situation where `BQP` behaves, in practice, like an elaborated version of `BPP` or `P` for the problems that matter, even if the classes are not provably equal.

### 5.2 World F: robust quantum advantage beyond P

World F represents a scenario where quantum computers provide genuine structural advantage on some natural problems that matter at realistic scales.

Effective layer properties:

1. **Persistent classification tension**

   There exist problem families `L_k` such that:

   ```txt
   C_quantum(m_F; L_k, k) = 1
   C_class(m_F; L_k, k)   = 0
   Gap_advantage(m_F; L_k, k) grows with k
   ```

   and this pattern is hard to remove without strongly contradicting the reference classification or known algorithms.

2. **Resource committed advantage**

   ```txt
   DeltaS_resource(m_F) is moderate or manageable
   ```

   in the sense that the required quantum resources lie within the physically plausible region defined by Q032 / Q059. The advantage is not purely hypothetical at inhuman scales.

3. **Lower bound on tension**

   ```txt
   Tension_Q052(m_F) >= delta_Q052
   ```

   for some fixed `delta_Q052 > 0`. Attempts to force the tension below this threshold while staying inside the admissible encoding class either:

   * Contradict known quantum algorithms, or
   * Deny feasible resource profiles without physical justification.

This world pattern corresponds to a situation where robust quantum advantage is a structural feature of the landscape, not a local artefact.

### 5.3 Interpretive note

These world patterns are **not** claims about reality. They serve only as:

* Reference configurations for how `DeltaS_comp`, `DeltaS_resource`, and `Tension_Q052` would behave if one or the other broad picture were correct.
* Test beds for whether a given encoding is sensitive enough to separate qualitatively different scenarios.

They do not introduce any deep TU fields and they do not privilege any actual position on `P` versus `BQP`.

---

## 6. Falsifiability and discriminating experiments

This block specifies experiments that can **falsify particular encodings or parameter choices** for Q052 at the effective layer. They cannot prove or disprove any complexity class relations.

### 6.0 Logging and audit requirements

Every Q052 experiment must log at least:

* `problem_id = Q052`
* `encoding_key = ENC_PVBQP_DISCRETE_V1`
* A reference to the versions or hashes of:

  * `C_ref`, `Q_ref`,
  * `K_Q052`,
  * weights `w_comp`, `w_res`, `w_Lk`, `v_k`,
  * `Resource_limit(k)` profiles imported from Q032 / Q059.
* A precise description or hash of:

  * The set of problems `L_set` used in the experiment,
  * The set of scales actually instantiated,
  * Any oracle or world pattern considered.
* The resulting summaries:

  * `DeltaS_comp(m)`, `DeltaS_resource(m)`, `Tension_Q052(m)` for each state `m` studied,
  * Any derived statistics used in the conclusions.

These logs must be sufficient for an external auditor to reconstruct the experiment at the effective layer and verify whether the admissible class conditions were respected.

---

### Experiment 1: Oracle world separation test

**Goal.**
Test whether `DeltaS_comp` and `Tension_Q052` can reliably distinguish oracle worlds where `BQP` has provably different power relative to classical classes, under a fixed admissible encoding.

**Setup.**

* Choose a finite set of oracles `A` with the following property:

  * Some oracles in the set give `BQP^A` power not captured by `P^A` or low levels of `PH^A`.
  * Other oracles yield relativized worlds where `BQP^A` behaves closer to classical classes on the chosen portfolio.

* Fix once and for all for this experiment:

  * The encoding key `ENC_PVBQP_DISCRETE_V1`,
  * `C_ref`, `Q_ref`, `K_Q052`,
  * weights `w_comp`, `w_res`, `w_Lk`, `v_k`,
  * and `Resource_limit(k)`.

* For each oracle `A`, define a state `m_A` in `M_reg_Q052` that encodes:

  * Which problems in a fixed test set `L_set` are known to be efficiently solvable by `BQP^A`,
  * Which of those are also classically feasible in `P^A` at the same scales,
  * Coarse resource profiles for the corresponding algorithms.

**Protocol.**

1. Construct `m_A` for each oracle `A` using only published results about the relativized world, not any additional conjectures.

2. For each `m_A`, compute:

   * `DeltaS_comp(m_A)`,
   * `DeltaS_resource(m_A)`,
   * `Tension_Q052(m_A)`.

3. Partition the oracles into two groups:

   * Group T: oracles where `BQP^A` appears close to `P^A` on the tested set.
   * Group F: oracles where `BQP^A` has provable or strong evidence of strictly greater power on the tested set.

4. Compare the distributions of `Tension_Q052(m_A)` between Group T and Group F.

**Metrics.**

* Means and variances of `Tension_Q052(m_A)` for Group T and Group F.
* A simple separation statistic such as difference of means, or a rank based measure.
* Stability of these statistics under small admissible changes in:

  * The portfolio `L_set`,
  * The weights `w_Lk` consistent with the encoding key.

**Falsification conditions.**

An encoding choice is considered **falsified as a useful discriminator** if:

* After fixing the encoding once, the observed `Tension_Q052(m_A)` values show no meaningful separation between Group T and Group F, or
* Small admissible variations in reference profiles or resource limits cause inversions where oracles with stronger `BQP^A` power have consistently lower tension than oracles with weaker `BQP^A` power, without any supporting mathematical reason.

**Boundary note.**
Falsifying a Q052 encoding does **not** solve any canonical complexity question. It only shows that this particular choice of `DeltaS_comp`, `DeltaS_resource`, and `Tension_Q052` is not a good spectral discriminator for oracle worlds.

### Experiment 2: Quantum speedup candidate portfolio

**Goal.**
Evaluate whether `Tension_Q052` assigns coherent tension levels across a portfolio of candidate quantum speedup problems compared to their classical baselines, under a fixed admissible encoding.

**Setup.**

* Select a finite portfolio of candidate problems `L_1, ..., L_n`, such as:

  * Integer factoring,
  * Discrete logarithm in specific group families,
  * Selected hidden subgroup problems with known quantum algorithms.

* For each `L_j`, assemble:

  * A classical baseline complexity estimate (best known deterministic or randomized algorithm exponents and resource use),
  * A quantum algorithm complexity estimate (for example exponents from Shor type or other quantum algorithms),
  * Coarse resource and error tolerance data consistent with Q032 / Q059 to decide whether the quantum algorithm is physically plausible at some scales.

* Using the fixed encoding key, define for each `L_j` a state `m_j` in `M_reg_Q052` that encodes these summaries.

**Protocol.**

1. For each candidate problem `L_j`:

   * Construct `m_j` using the chosen portfolio, scales, and resource limits.
   * Compute the observables:

     ```txt
     C_class(m_j; L_j, k)
     C_quantum(m_j; L_j, k)
     Gap_advantage(m_j; L_j, k)
     DeltaS_comp(m_j)
     DeltaS_resource(m_j)
     Tension_Q052(m_j)
     ```

2. Repeat step 1 with one or more **conservative** variants of classical baselines (for example slightly better hypothetical classical exponents) to test robustness.

**Metrics.**

* The ranking of problems by `Tension_Q052(m_j)` compared to expert intuition about how strong each quantum advantage is.
* Sensitivity of `Tension_Q052(m_j)` to conservative changes in classical baselines.
* Detection of anomalies where:

  * A problem with apparently weaker quantum advantage gets consistently higher `Tension_Q052` than a problem with stronger advantage, without explanation from resource constraints.

**Falsification conditions.**

* If under the fixed admissible encoding the portfolio displays frequent, unexplained anomalies in tension ranking, the current form of `F_Q052`, `DeltaS_comp`, or `DeltaS_resource` is considered misaligned with the stated purpose and must be revised.
* If small, justified changes in resource limits or baseline assumptions cause large, unstable swings in `Tension_Q052(m_j)` without clear structural reasons, the encoding is considered too fragile for engineering use.

**Boundary note.**
Again, falsifying a Q052 encoding does not decide whether quantum advantage is real or not. It simply shows that this particular effective layer representation does not behave in a stable or interpretable way on a concrete portfolio.

## 7. AI and WFGY engineering spec

This block describes how Q052 structures can be used as engineering modules in AI systems, without exposing any deep TU dynamics.

### 7.1 Training signals

We define several training signals that can be derived from Q052 observables.

1. **`signal_quantum_advantage_consistency`**

   * Definition: a penalty signal proportional to `DeltaS_comp(m)` for internal states `m` inferred from the model’s beliefs about which problems are classically vs quantum feasible.
   * Purpose: discourage inconsistent or unsupported claims such as declaring that “quantum computers can solve everything efficiently” or that “quantum advantage is irrelevant everywhere” without respecting the reference classification.

2. **`signal_resource_feasibility_gap`**

   * Definition: a penalty derived from `DeltaS_resource(m)` that increases when the model assumes quantum algorithms that require resources far beyond the physical limits encoded in Q032 / Q059.
   * Purpose: align the model’s reasoning about quantum algorithms with realistic resource constraints, avoiding fantasies where arbitrary speedups are claimed without cost.

3. **`signal_oracle_world_stability`**

   * Definition: a measure of how much `Tension_Q052(m)` changes when the model is prompted to reason in different oracle scenarios that, mathematically, should preserve or break certain types of quantum advantage.
   * Purpose: encourage internal representations of complexity that respect known relativized patterns rather than reshuffling them arbitrarily from one prompt to another.

4. **`signal_problem_portfolio_ordering`**

   * Definition: a signal that penalizes internal states that invert the tension ordering of a fixed benchmark portfolio of candidate quantum speedup problems, as defined in Experiment 2.
   * Purpose: make the model’s internal beliefs about quantum advantage track a coherent partial order across tasks.

### 7.2 Architectural patterns

We sketch some module patterns that reuse Q052 components.

1. **`QuantumAdvantage_TensionHead`**

   * Role: given an internal representation of a computational task and its context, output an estimated contribution to `Tension_Q052(m)`.
   * Interface:

     * Inputs: embeddings representing the problem statement, assumed baselines, and resource assumptions.
     * Outputs: a scalar tension estimate and, optionally, a small vector splitting `DeltaS_comp` and `DeltaS_resource`.

2. **`ComplexityLandscape_Field_Module`**

   * Role: maintain an internal discrete field approximating `ComplexityLandscape_Field` over a finite set `L_set` relevant to the current interaction.
   * Interface:

     * Inputs: structured claims about feasibility, complexity, and algorithmic structure.
     * Outputs: updates to `C_class`, `C_quantum`, `Gap_advantage`, and related indicators.

3. **`OracleWorld_Complexity_Template`**

   * Role: provide a reusable template for simulating different oracle worlds inside the model, each corresponding to a state `m_A` in `M_reg_Q052`.
   * Interface:

     * Inputs: a description of an oracle or relativized scenario.
     * Outputs: internal adjustments to the complexity indicators consistent with that scenario and tests based on `DeltaS_comp` and `Tension_Q052`.

### 7.3 Evaluation harness

We outline an evaluation harness for AI systems with Q052 modules.

1. **Task selection**

   * Questions about:

     * Capabilities and limitations of quantum computers,
     * Relationships between `P`, `BPP`, `NP`, `BQP`, and related classes,
     * Interpretations of oracle results and candidate quantum speedups.

2. **Conditions**

   * Baseline: model without explicit Q052 modules.
   * TU enhanced: same model with Q052 training signals and modules active.

3. **Metrics**

   * Structural consistency: fraction of answers that respect known inclusions and standard complexity facts.
   * Resource realism: frequency of proposals that require unphysical quantum resources without warning.
   * Stability under counterfactual prompts: how often the model preserves coherent differences between “no quantum advantage” versus “strong quantum advantage” hypothetical worlds.

### 7.4 60 second reproduction protocol

A lightweight protocol for external users to experience Q052 style behavior.

* **Baseline prompt**

  > Explain, in simple terms, what quantum computers can and cannot do compared to classical computers, including the relationship between `P` and `BQP`.

* **TU encoded prompt**

  > Using the idea of *computational tension* between classical and quantum resources, explain what `BQP` is, how it relates to `P`, and why quantum advantage is believed to matter or might fail to matter.

Users can then compare:

* How clearly the search for speedups and the resource limits are discussed,
* How explicitly the model separates proven facts from conjectures,
* Whether the explanation acknowledges that the status of `P` versus `BQP` is open.

Logs should record prompts, answers, and any available internal tension estimates.

## 8. Cross problem transfer template

This block records reusable components produced by Q052 and how they transfer to other S problems.

### 8.1 Reusable components

1. **ComponentName:** `QuantumAdvantage_TensionScore`

   * Type: functional

   * Minimal interface:

     ```txt
     Inputs:
       classical_cost_summary
       quantum_cost_summary
       resource_profile
     Output:
       tension_value >= 0
     ```

   * Preconditions:

     * Cost summaries and resource profiles are finite and consistent with `ENC_PVBQP_DISCRETE_V1`.
     * The mapping from these summaries into `DeltaS_comp` and `DeltaS_resource` is fixed by the encoding key.

2. **ComponentName:** `ComplexityLandscape_Field`

   * Type: field

   * Minimal interface:

     ```txt
     Inputs:
       finite_problem_set L_set
       resolution_scales K_Q052
     Output:
       discrete field over (L_set, K_Q052) encoding
         C_class, C_quantum, Gap_advantage
     ```

   * Preconditions:

     * `L_set` and `K_Q052` are finite.
     * The state space and observables are consistent with the discrete semantics.

3. **ComponentName:** `OracleWorld_Complexity_Template`

   * Type: experiment_pattern

   * Minimal interface:

     ```txt
     Inputs:
       description of relativized world or oracle A
     Output:
       instructions for constructing state m_A in M_reg_Q052
       plus tests based on DeltaS_comp and Tension_Q052
     ```

   * Preconditions:

     * There is enough information about the relativized world to map complexity facts into the effective observables used in Q052.

### 8.2 Direct reuse targets

1. **Q051 (P versus NP)**

   * Reused component: `ComplexityLandscape_Field`.
   * Why: Q051 needs a similar discrete complexity landscape, focusing on `P` vs `NP` and search vs verification, rather than classical vs quantum cost.
   * Changes: the observables and gap functionals are adjusted to use NP verification properties instead of quantum resources.

2. **Q059 (thermodynamic cost of information processing)**

   * Reused component: `QuantumAdvantage_TensionScore`.
   * Why: Q059 aims to connect computational advantage with thermodynamic cost. The tension score provides a quantitative link between complexity based advantage and thermodynamic variables.
   * Changes: the `resource_profile` input is extended to include heat, entropy production, and physical time, following Q032 / Q059.

3. **Q121 (AI alignment problem)**

   * Reused component: `OracleWorld_Complexity_Template`.
   * Why: alignment protocols might depend on assumptions about which tasks are efficiently solvable. The template allows systematic exploration of different computational worlds for oversight schemes.
   * Changes: the finite problem set and resource scales are chosen to match alignment and oversight tasks, not pure complexity benchmarks.

## 9. TU roadmap and verification levels

This block tracks Q052 inside the broader TU program.

### 9.1 Current levels

* **E_level: E1**

  * Q052 has a coherent effective encoding with:

    * A discrete state space `M_Q052`,
    * Observables and fields,
    * Mismatch functionals `DeltaS_comp`, `DeltaS_resource`,
    * A tension functional `Tension_Q052`,
    * A clearly defined singular set `S_sing_Q052`.
  * There is no requirement yet for full implementations. The emphasis is on definitional clarity and auditability.

* **N_level: N1**

  * The narrative that connects classical and quantum complexity, resource limits, and computational_tension is explicit and internally consistent.
  * Counterfactual World T and World F patterns are described in a way that can be instantiated at least in toy models and oracle based examples.

### 9.2 Next measurable step toward E2

To reach E2, at least one of the following should be implemented and published with logs:

1. A concrete **oracle world separation test** (Experiment 1) using a small set of oracles and problems, with `DeltaS_comp`, `DeltaS_resource`, and `Tension_Q052` computed and released as open data.

2. A prototype implementation of `QuantumAdvantage_TensionScore` applied to a portfolio of candidate quantum speedup problems (Experiment 2), again with full tension results and parameters made public.

In both cases:

* The encoding key, reference profiles, resource limits, and portfolios must be fixed and documented.
* The logs must be sufficient for external auditors to reconstruct the experiment and check admissibility.

### 9.3 Long term role of Q052

In the longer term Q052 is intended to act as:

* The central node for questions about the **structural role of quantum computers** in efficient computation inside TU.
* A test bed for how TU encodings manage tradeoffs between:

  * Mathematical complexity results,
  * Physical resource limits,
  * Engineering practice.
* A bridge between complexity theory, quantum information, thermodynamics, and AI system design, through reusable effective layer components.

## 10. Elementary but precise explanation

This block gives a non specialist oriented explanation that still respects the effective layer view.

Classically we divide computational problems into “easy” and “hard” ones. The class `P` is a formal way to say “easy” in this context. A problem is in `P` if there is an algorithm that solves it in time bounded by some polynomial in the input size.

When quantum computers arrived, researchers defined another class, `BQP`. This is the set of problems a quantum computer can solve efficiently, again in polynomial time, but allowing a small error probability.

The big conceptual question is:

> Do quantum computers really let us solve new problems efficiently that classical computers can never solve efficiently?

If the answer is no, then for the problems that matter, `BQP` behaves almost like `P`. If the answer is yes, then `BQP` is strictly larger and quantum computers open a new region of the complexity landscape.

In this document we do **not** try to answer that question. Instead we ask something slightly different:

* Given a certain story about what quantum computers can do,
  and a certain set of physical limits,
  how much **tension** does this story create.

To do that, we imagine a space of states. Each state:

* Lists some problems we care about.
* Records, at some rough scale, whether we treat each problem as classically feasible, quantum feasible, both, or neither.
* Summarizes how big the gap between classical and quantum costs looks.
* Records how much quantum hardware and error correction we are assuming.

From these summaries we build two numbers:

1. A **classification mismatch**, which grows if we keep telling a story about what is easy or hard that contradicts standard complexity knowledge or our own chosen reference profile.

2. A **resource mismatch**, which grows if we rely on quantum algorithms that need far more hardware or precision than our physical limits allow.

We then combine them into a single **tension score**.

* In a world where quantum computers are not doing much that is fundamentally new, we should be able to keep this tension score small and stable as we refine our models.
* In a world where quantum advantage is robust and physically meaningful, we expect the tension score to stay bounded away from zero when we honestly encode everything we know.

Q052 is the node that formalizes this idea. It does not decide which world we live in. It only gives us a precise way to:

* Describe what would be different between the two scenarios,
* Test whether particular encodings or narratives about quantum computation are coherent,
* Build engineering modules for AI systems that take complexity limits and resource constraints seriously.

## Tension Universe effective-layer footer

This page is part of the **WFGY / Tension Universe** S-problem collection.

### Scope of claims

* The goal of this document is to specify an **effective-layer encoding** of the problem “P vs BQP / role of quantum computers”.
* It does **not** claim to prove or disprove any canonical complexity class statement, including but not limited to `P = BQP`, `P ⊊ BQP`, or any inclusion between `BQP` and other standard classes.
* It does **not** introduce any new theorem beyond what is already established in the cited literature.
* It should **not** be cited as evidence that any open complexity problem has been solved.

### Effective-layer boundary

* All objects used here (state spaces `M_Q052`, observables, mismatch functionals, tension tensors, counterfactual worlds) live entirely at the **effective layer** of the TU framework.
* No claim is made about the existence, uniqueness, or correctness of any deep TU generative mechanism that might underlie these effective observables.
* Any “World T / World F” description in this document is defined purely as a pattern of observables and tension scores, not as a statement about which world is actual.

### Encoding and fairness

* The encoding key `ENC_PVBQP_DISCRETE_V1` specifies a fixed admissible class of encodings, including reference profiles, weights, resolution scales, and resource limits.
* Reference profiles may include conjectural labels reflecting current community beliefs, but these labels are not treated as theorems and can be audited independently.
* Encodings that tune reference profiles or weights after seeing experimental results are considered non admissible and are outside the scope of this page.

### Verification and updates

* Experiments and implementations based on this page must log sufficient metadata to allow independent reproduction and audit at the effective layer.
* Future revisions to this page should:

  * Preserve the distinction between canonical complexity statements and effective-layer encodings,
  * Record changes in the header metadata, especially `Encoding_key` and `Last_updated`,
  * Maintain compatibility with the TU charters listed below.

This page should be read together with the following charters:

* [TU Effective Layer Charter](../Charters/TU_EFFECTIVE_LAYER_CHARTER.md)
* [TU Encoding and Fairness Charter](../Charters/TU_ENCODING_AND_FAIRNESS_CHARTER.md)
* [TU Tension Scale Charter](../Charters/TU_TENSION_SCALE_CHARTER.md)
* [TU Global Guardrails](../Charters/TU_GLOBAL_GUARDRAILS.md)

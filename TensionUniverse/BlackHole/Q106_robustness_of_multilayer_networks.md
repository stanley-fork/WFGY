## 0. Effective layer disclaimer

All claims in this entry are made strictly at the effective layer of the Tension Universe (TU) framework.

1. Scope of this document

   * This page defines an effective layer encoding of Q106.
   * It specifies state space structure, admissible encodings, observables, mismatch quantities, tension functionals, counterfactual worlds, experiments, and AI facing interfaces.
   * It does not introduce any new theorem about robustness of multilayer networks beyond what is already known in the cited literature.
   * It does not assert that multilayer robustness has a unique or universal encoding.

2. No deep generative rule is exposed

   * Objects such as `M`, `E_enc_multi`, `M_reg(e_multi)`, `StructProfile`, `InterdepProfile`, `CascadeMap`, `R_simple`, `R_cascade`, `DeltaS_struct`, `DeltaS_cascade`, `DeltaS_multi`, `DeltaS_total`, `Tension_multi`, and the tensor `T_ij(m)` are bookkeeping devices at the effective layer.
   * This document does not specify any raw data maps or bottom level generative rules from physical systems into TU fields.
   * Any such maps, if they exist, belong to separate implementation documents and are not part of the Q106 statement.

3. Counterfactual worlds are pattern descriptions

   * The worlds labeled `World T` and `World F` are defined purely in terms of patterns of observables and tension values under fixed encodings.
   * They are not metaphysical claims about the actual universe.
   * They are used only to separate classes of behavior: worlds where low tension multilayer designs are achievable and stable, and worlds where high tension is persistent inside realistic constraints.

4. Experiments test encodings, not the canonical statement itself

   * The experiments in Block 6 are discriminating tests for particular TU encodings of Q106.
   * Passing an experiment means that a given encoding behaves coherently on the chosen model class.
   * Failing an experiment falsifies that encoding and its parameter ranges for that model class.
   * In both cases, the canonical question of Q106 remains open at the level of full generality.
   * In particular, falsifying a TU encoding is not the same as proving any impossibility theorem about real world multilayer robustness.

5. Finite libraries, fixed weights, fixed thresholds

   * All structural reference sets, shock pattern libraries, resolution levels, distance functions, and aggregation recipes belong to finite libraries that are fixed once per encoding.
   * All weights and thresholds that appear in the definitions of mismatch quantities and tension functionals are fixed for each encoding before any data are examined.
   * They are not tuned per state or per experiment outcome.
   * Changing libraries, weights, or threshold sets defines a new encoding and requires a separate evaluation.

This page should be read together with the global TU charters listed in the footer, which specify the common effective layer, encoding, and tension scale conventions for all S level problems.

## 1. Canonical problem and status

### 1.1 Canonical statement

Many real systems are better described as multilayer or interconnected networks than as single graphs. Examples include:

* power grid, communication network, and control systems
* financial institutions and real economy linkages
* transportation networks with multiple modes
* social, organizational, and information layers in one society

The canonical question behind Q106 is:

> Given a multilayer network with specified intra layer connections, inter layer dependencies, and load or flow patterns, how robust is the system to node and edge failures or targeted attacks, and when do naive robustness metrics fail to predict large cascades or systemic collapse?

In more concrete terms:

* Single layer graph theory has many robustness indicators such as degree distribution, k core, percolation thresholds, algebraic connectivity.
* In multilayer settings a system can look robust by each single layer metric while still being extremely fragile once interdependencies and cascades are considered.

The canonical problem asks for a principled framework to:

1. define robustness for multilayer networks at an effective theoretical level
2. compare naive or local metrics with true cascade based robustness
3. identify conditions under which multilayer structure amplifies or suppresses tail risk of large cascades

Q106 does not aim to solve all applied cases. It reframes the question as a structured risk_tail_tension problem on multilayer network states.

### 1.2 Status and difficulty

Key partial results in the literature include:

* Demonstrations that interdependent networks can experience abrupt, catastrophic percolation transitions where small additional damage triggers large cascades.
* Formal frameworks for multiplex and multilayer networks with clear notation and basic robustness metrics.
* Case studies in infrastructure, finance, and other socio technical systems that show real events where hidden dependencies produced unexpected failures.

However:

* There is no universally accepted definition of robustness for multilayer systems that covers both structural properties and cascade behavior.
* Naive extensions of single layer metrics often fail in practice and can underestimate tail risk.
* Systematic tools to compare different definitions of robustness under common experiments are still under development.

From the BlackHole perspective, Q106 is treated as an S rank problem because:

* it sits at a junction of graph theory, statistical physics, and socio technical risk
* wrong models can lead to large real world losses
* a clean, general, falsifiable effective layer encoding is still nontrivial

### 1.3 Role in the BlackHole project

Within the BlackHole S collection, Q106 has three main roles:

1. It is the reference node for risk_tail_tension in multilayer networked systems.
2. It supplies reusable components such as a MultilayerNetworkField and a RobustnessGapFunctional for downstream problems on systemic crashes and collective action.
3. It provides a template for how to encode complex socio technical problems at the effective layer without hiding arbitrary parameter choices or post hoc tuning.

## 2. Position in the BlackHole graph

This block records how Q106 sits inside the BlackHole graph of Q001 to Q125.

## 3. Tension Universe encoding (effective layer)

All content in this block is at the effective layer. No generative rules from raw data to internal TU fields are specified here.

### 3.1 State space

We assume a hybrid semantic state space

```txt
M
```

whose elements represent abstract multilayer network states at the effective layer.

Each state `m` in `M` has the following components:

* A finite node set

  ```txt
  V(m), with |V(m)| <= N_cap
  ```

* A finite layer index set

  ```txt
  L(m), with |L(m)| <= L_cap
  ```

* For each layer index `ell` in `L(m)`, a directed or undirected adjacency pattern

  ```txt
  E_ell(m) subset of V(m) x V(m)
  ```

* A set of interlayer dependency relations

  ```txt
  D(m) subset of V(m) x L(m) x V(m) x L(m)
  ```

  that encodes which node in which layer depends on which other node and layer.

* Per node and per layer load and capacity summaries

  ```txt
  load(m; v, ell)
  cap(m; v, ell)
  ```

* A damage state map

  ```txt
  damage(m; v, ell) in {intact, failed, disabled}
  ```

for all `v` in `V(m)` and `ell` in `L(m)`.

We do not specify how any of these objects are constructed from real systems. We only require that for each state `m` the above quantities are well defined and finite.

### 3.2 Observables and fields

We introduce the following effective observables. For each encoding they are implemented through recipes chosen from fixed finite libraries.

1. Layer structural profile

```txt
StructProfile(m; ell)
```

* Input: state `m` and layer `ell` in `L(m)`.
* Output: a finite dimensional vector of structural features, for example average degree, clustering, and approximate size of the largest connected component within that layer.
* Requirement: there exists a fixed finite feature library, chosen once for all states in a given encoding.

2. Interdependence profile

```txt
InterdepProfile(m)
```

* Input: state `m`.
* Output: a finite dimensional vector summarizing the structure of interlayer dependencies `D(m)`, for example average number of dependencies per node, distribution of dependency chain lengths, and measures of redundancy.
* Requirement: the summary is computed using a fixed finite library of patterns that does not change between states.

3. Cascade response map

```txt
CascadeMap(m; shock_pattern, r)
```

* Input: state `m`, a shock pattern that selects an initial set of failed nodes, and a resolution index `r` which bounds the cascade depth or time steps.
* Output: a finite dimensional vector of cascade outcome statistics, such as total failed nodes, per layer failure fractions, and whether the system remained connected above a threshold.
* Requirement: for each encoding and each allowed `r` the cascade map is well defined and terminates in at most `r` steps.

4. Simple robustness indicator

```txt
R_simple(m)
```

* Input: state `m`.
* Output: a scalar score between 0 and 1 constructed only from StructProfile and InterdepProfile, using fixed weights and thresholds from a finite library.
* Interpretation: a naive estimate of robustness based on local and single layer structural information.

5. Cascade based robustness indicator

```txt
R_cascade(m)
```

* Input: state `m`.
* Output: a scalar score between 0 and 1 derived from CascadeMap over a fixed finite library of shock patterns and resolution levels.
* Interpretation: an estimate of robustness based on observed cascade behavior across layers.

### 3.3 Mismatch observables

We define three nonnegative mismatch observables. All distance functions and reference sets are chosen once per encoding from finite libraries and do not depend on individual states.

1. Structural mismatch

```txt
DeltaS_struct(m) >= 0
```

This quantity measures mismatch between the actual structural profile (StructProfile and InterdepProfile) and a fixed admissible reference class of structures that are considered balanced for given loads and capacities.

* There exists an admissible structural reference class

  ```txt
  E_ref_struct
  ```

  that is specified once for a given encoding and does not depend on any particular state `m`.
* `DeltaS_struct(m)` is defined as a distance between the structural summary of `m` and the nearest member of `E_ref_struct`, using a fixed distance function selected from a finite distance library.

2. Cascade mismatch

```txt
DeltaS_cascade(m) >= 0
```

This quantity measures mismatch between cascade based robustness `R_cascade(m)` and the simple indicator `R_simple(m)`.

* If `R_simple(m)` predicts high robustness but `R_cascade(m)` shows large failures on the fixed shock library, `DeltaS_cascade(m)` is large.
* If `R_simple(m)` and `R_cascade(m)` agree within fixed tolerances from a finite threshold set, `DeltaS_cascade(m)` is small.

3. Multilayer mismatch

```txt
DeltaS_multi(m) >= 0
```

This quantity measures mismatch between robustness measured on each individual layer and robustness measured at the coupled multilayer level.

* For each layer `ell` we can compute a single layer robustness indicator

  ```txt
  R_layer(m; ell)
  ```

  using only `E_ell(m)` and local loads.
* `DeltaS_multi(m)` is defined as a measure of disagreement between the collection of `R_layer(m; ell)` and the global `R_cascade(m)`, again using a distance or dispersion function chosen from a fixed finite library.

### 3.4 Admissible encodings and fairness constraints

We work with an admissible encoding class for Q106 at the effective layer.

1. Encoding class

```txt
E_enc_multi
```

is a collection of encodings. Each encoding

```txt
e_multi in E_enc_multi
```

specifies:

* bounds on network size and degree
* bounds on loads and capacities
* finite libraries for structural references, shock patterns, resolution levels, distance functions, aggregation recipes, and thresholds
* fixed weight vectors used to combine mismatch quantities

All of these choices are fixed once per encoding and do not depend on individual states or experimental outcomes.

2. Admissible state subset for an encoding

For each encoding `e_multi` in `E_enc_multi` we define its admissible state subset

```txt
M_adm(e_multi) subset of M
```

by the following constraints:

* Bounded size and degree

  ```txt
  |V(m)| <= N_max(e_multi)
  |L(m)| <= L_max(e_multi)
  max degree per layer in m <= d_max(e_multi)
  ```

  where `N_max(e_multi)`, `L_max(e_multi)`, and `d_max(e_multi)` are fixed finite constants chosen as part of the encoding.

* Bounded loads and capacities

  ```txt
  0 <= load(m; v, ell) <= L_bound(e_multi)
  0 < cap(m; v, ell)  <= C_bound(e_multi)
  ```

  with fixed bounds that do not depend on `m`.

* Fixed finite libraries

  * A finite library of structural reference patterns for `E_ref_struct`.

  * A finite library of shock patterns used by `CascadeMap`.

  * A finite set of resolution levels

    ```txt
    R_levels(e_multi) = {r_1, r_2, ..., r_K}
    ```

  * Finite libraries of distance functions, aggregation recipes, and threshold values.

These libraries are chosen once for `e_multi` and may not be changed when individual states are evaluated or when experimental results are inspected.

3. Fixed weights

Whenever a combined quantity uses weights, these weights are fixed at encoding time:

```txt
w_struct(e_multi) > 0
w_cascade(e_multi) > 0
w_multi(e_multi)   > 0
w_struct + w_cascade + w_multi = 1
```

These weights do not depend on `m`. Changing the weights defines a new encoding in `E_enc_multi`.

4. Resolution control

Any invariant involving a supremum or infimum is taken over the discrete set `R_levels(e_multi)` rather than over arbitrary resolution choices. This avoids hidden free parameters that could be tuned per state.

### 3.5 Effective tension tensor and singular set

For each encoding `e_multi` in `E_enc_multi` and each admissible state `m` we define an effective tension tensor.

1. Index sets

We fix two finite index sets associated with `e_multi`:

```txt
I_src(e_multi)
J_recv(e_multi)
```

They encode semantic source components and semantic receiver components. The sizes of these sets are bounded by a fixed constant for the encoding and do not change between states.

2. Combined mismatch

We define the combined mismatch as

```txt
DeltaS_total(m; e_multi) =
    w_struct(e_multi)  * DeltaS_struct(m)  +
    w_cascade(e_multi) * DeltaS_cascade(m) +
    w_multi(e_multi)   * DeltaS_multi(m)
```

for all admissible states `m`.

3. Tension tensor

For each `i` in `I_src(e_multi)` and each `j` in `J_recv(e_multi)` we define

```txt
T_ij(m; e_multi) =
    S_i(m; e_multi) *
    C_j(m; e_multi) *
    DeltaS_total(m; e_multi) *
    lambda(m; e_multi) *
    kappa(e_multi)
```

where:

* `S_i(m; e_multi)` are source like factors that encode how strongly the `i`th semantic component contributes to network stress in state `m`.
* `C_j(m; e_multi)` are receptivity like factors for the `j`th component that receives or amplifies stress.
* `lambda(m; e_multi)` is a convergence state factor that satisfies

  ```txt
  0 <= lambda(m; e_multi) <= 1
  ```

  for all admissible states.
* `kappa(e_multi)` is a fixed positive coupling constant for Q106 under encoding `e_multi`.

The functions `S_i`, `C_j`, and `lambda` are effective layer quantities. They are defined by recipes chosen from finite libraries at encoding time and are not tuned per state using outcome information.

4. Singular set and regular domain

Some states may produce undefined or divergent mismatch values. For each encoding `e_multi` we define the singular set

```txt
S_sing(e_multi) = {
  m in M_adm(e_multi) :
    DeltaS_struct(m)  is undefined or not finite, or
    DeltaS_cascade(m) is undefined or not finite, or
    DeltaS_multi(m)   is undefined or not finite
}
```

The regular domain for Q106 under encoding `e_multi` is

```txt
M_reg(e_multi) = M_adm(e_multi) \ S_sing(e_multi)
```

All Q106 analysis and experiments are restricted to `M_reg(e_multi)`. When a proposed experiment would require evaluating `DeltaS_struct`, `DeltaS_cascade`, or `DeltaS_multi` on a state in `S_sing(e_multi)`, the result is treated as out of domain rather than as empirical evidence.

---

## 4. Tension principle for this problem

### 4.1 Core tension functional

For each encoding `e_multi` and each state `m` in `M_reg(e_multi)` we define the Q106 tension functional as

```txt
Tension_multi(m; e_multi) =
    G(DeltaS_struct(m),
      DeltaS_cascade(m),
      DeltaS_multi(m); e_multi)
```

where `G` is a fixed nonnegative function chosen once for the encoding. A common choice is a weighted sum:

```txt
Tension_multi(m; e_multi) =
    alpha(e_multi) * DeltaS_struct(m)
  + beta(e_multi)  * DeltaS_cascade(m)
  + gamma(e_multi) * DeltaS_multi(m)
```

with

```txt
alpha(e_multi) > 0
beta(e_multi)  > 0
gamma(e_multi) > 0
alpha + beta + gamma = 1
```

The function `G` and the weights `alpha`, `beta`, `gamma` belong to finite libraries and are fixed at encoding time. They do not depend on individual states or on experiment outcomes.

`G` must satisfy:

* `Tension_multi(m; e_multi) >= 0` for all `m` in `M_reg(e_multi)`.
* If all three mismatch terms are near 0 then `Tension_multi(m; e_multi)` is also near 0 in a way controlled by the TU Tension Scale Charter.
* If any mismatch grows while others remain bounded then `Tension_multi(m; e_multi)` grows at least linearly in that mismatch for a range defined by the tension scale.

### 4.2 Low tension regime

For each encoding `e_multi` the TU Tension Scale Charter specifies a finite set of low tension thresholds

```txt
epsilon_struct(e_multi)
epsilon_cascade(e_multi)
epsilon_multi(e_multi)
epsilon_multi_total(e_multi)
```

A multilayer network state `m` in `M_reg(e_multi)` is in the low tension regime if:

1. Structural compatibility

```txt
DeltaS_struct(m) <= epsilon_struct(e_multi)
```

2. Cascade agreement

```txt
DeltaS_cascade(m) <= epsilon_cascade(e_multi)
```

so that simple robustness indicators and cascade based indicators agree within the prescribed tolerance.

3. Multilayer alignment

```txt
DeltaS_multi(m) <= epsilon_multi(e_multi)
```

so that per layer robustness indicators and global robustness indicators are consistent.

In this regime we expect

```txt
Tension_multi(m; e_multi) <= epsilon_multi_total(e_multi)
```

Low tension means that simple metrics do not systematically underestimate or overestimate robustness and that multilayer coupling does not create hidden fragility inside `M_reg(e_multi)`.

### 4.3 High tension regime

The Tension Scale Charter also specifies a finite set of high tension thresholds. For each encoding `e_multi` we pick a high tension threshold

```txt
delta_multi(e_multi) > 0
```

from that set.

A state `m` in `M_reg(e_multi)` is in the high tension regime if

```txt
Tension_multi(m; e_multi) >= delta_multi(e_multi)
```

and `m` cannot be moved into the low tension regime by small structural changes that:

* keep `m` inside `M_adm(e_multi)`
* preserve the fixed libraries, weights, and thresholds of `e_multi`

Typical high tension patterns include:

* large `DeltaS_cascade(m)` where `R_simple(m)` predicts robustness but cascades are severe
* large `DeltaS_multi(m)` where per layer indicators look safe but coupled behavior is fragile
* structural patterns that are far from `E_ref_struct` even after allowed adjustments within the encoding

Q106 focuses on the classification of states into these regimes and on how often real or model systems fall into high tension configurations under realistic constraints.

---

## 5. Counterfactual tension worlds

We now describe two counterfactual worlds strictly at the effective layer and strictly relative to a fixed choice of encoding class, libraries, and tension scale.

### 5.1 World T: achievable robust multilayer design

World T represents a scenario where multilayer networks can be designed so that low tension is achievable and stable within the admissible encodings.

In World T there exists at least one encoding `e_T` in `E_enc_multi` and a family of states

```txt
{m_T(k)} subset of M_reg(e_T)
```

indexed by a resolution or size parameter `k` such that:

1. Low tension across scales

```txt
Tension_multi(m_T(k); e_T) <= epsilon_multi_total(e_T)
```

for all `k` in a wide range, with `epsilon_multi_total(e_T)` independent of `k`.

2. Stability under refinement

As resolution is refined by moving within `R_levels(e_T)` or by moving to a nearby encoding with slightly richer libraries that respect the same charter bounds, the family `{m_T(k)}` can be updated to keep `Tension_multi` below the same threshold without radical structural changes.

3. Correlation of metrics

In typical states `m_T(k)`, simple indicators derived from StructProfile and InterdepProfile correlate well with cascade based robustness. If `R_simple(m_T(k))` is high then `R_cascade(m_T(k))` is also high except for rare anomalies.

4. Constructive layering

Adding new layers or new interlayer links according to fixed design rules allows robustness to increase or at least not decrease. High tension patterns can be avoided or controlled within the admissible class.

### 5.2 World F: inherent multilayer fragility

World F represents a scenario where, for every encoding in a realistic encoding family for the domain, multilayer structure introduces unavoidable fragility.

Patterns in World F include:

1. Positive lower bound on tension

For each realistic encoding `e_F` in `E_enc_multi` there exists a strictly positive lower bound

```txt
delta_multi*(e_F) > 0
```

from the tension scale library such that for all realistic states `m` in `M_reg(e_F)` we have

```txt
Tension_multi(m; e_F) >= delta_multi*(e_F)
```

and this bound cannot be significantly reduced without leaving the admissible state constraints that capture realistic systems.

2. Systematic mismatch between metrics

For many states `m_F` in `M_reg(e_F)`:

* `R_simple(m_F)` predicts high robustness
* `R_cascade(m_F)` shows large cascades or frequent near collapse

So `DeltaS_cascade(m_F)` remains large.

3. Multilayer structural trap

Attempts to adjust structure while remaining in `M_adm(e_F)` only move tension between `DeltaS_struct`, `DeltaS_cascade`, and `DeltaS_multi`, without lowering `DeltaS_total` to a safe band for realistic parameter ranges.

4. Fragility from coupling

Layer coupling that is required by the domain, for example physical dependencies between infrastructures or institutional dependencies, cannot be modified enough to remove high tension. Fragility is then intrinsic at the effective layer for that encoding family.

### 5.3 Interpretive note

These worlds are described only through patterns of observables and tension values, and only relative to:

* the encoding class `E_enc_multi`
* the admissible state constraints for that class
* the finite libraries and tension scale specified in the TU charters

They are not claims that a particular real world domain is exactly in World T or World F. Instead they provide two clean poles that can be approached in practice when evidence accumulates.

---

## 6. Falsifiability and discriminating experiments

This block describes experiments that can falsify particular Q106 encodings of tension, without deciding the canonical problem for all real systems.

In each experiment we fix a single encoding

```txt
e_multi in E_enc_multi
```

including its libraries, weights, and thresholds. Any change to these choices defines a new encoding and requires a separate run.

### Experiment 1: synthetic multilayer cascade stress test

*Goal:*
Test whether the chosen `Tension_multi` encoding admits a stable low tension region inside `M_reg(e_multi)` under refinement within the allowed resolution ranges.

*Setup:*

* Choose a finite model class `M_syn(e_multi)` of synthetic multilayer networks with:

  * fixed `N_max(e_multi)`, `L_max(e_multi)`, and `d_max(e_multi)`
  * specified distributions for loads, capacities, and interlayer dependencies

* Fix all libraries required by `e_multi`:

  * `E_ref_struct`
  * shock pattern library
  * `R_levels(e_multi)`
  * distance and aggregation recipes
  * tension thresholds in a finite set

* Fix weights `w_struct(e_multi)`, `w_cascade(e_multi)`, `w_multi(e_multi)` and the function `G` before inspecting any outcomes.

*Protocol:*

1. Sample a grid of synthetic states `m` in `M_syn(e_multi)` that covers a range of coupling strengths and structural patterns.
2. For each `m`, compute `StructProfile`, `InterdepProfile`, and `CascadeMap` for all `r` in `R_levels(e_multi)`, then `R_simple(m)`, `R_cascade(m)`, and the three mismatch terms.
3. Compute `Tension_multi(m; e_multi)` for each state.
4. Using the pre declared finite set of candidate thresholds, identify low tension regions where `Tension_multi(m; e_multi)` is below `epsilon_multi_total(e_multi)`.
5. If the encoding family includes richer resolution sets `R_levels'(e_multi)` allowed by the charter, repeat steps 2 to 4 with those sets, treating them as separate encodings `e_multi'`.
6. Compare the low tension regions across these encodings.

*Metrics:*

* Distribution of `Tension_multi` values over `M_syn(e_multi)`.
* Size and structural location of the observed low tension region for each encoding.
* Stability of low tension regions across encodings that differ only by permitted resolution refinements.

*Falsification conditions:*

The encoding `e_multi` fails this test if both of the following hold.

1. For all candidate thresholds in the pre declared finite tension scale set there is no nonempty low tension region whose states share clear structural characteristics, or any such region shrinks to an empty set under allowed resolution refinements.
2. Small changes in libraries or weights within the constraints of `e_multi` cause arbitrarily large and structurally unmotivated changes in `Tension_multi` across `M_syn(e_multi)`.

In these cases the encoding is considered unstable or too sensitive to arbitrary choices, and is rejected as a robust multilayer robustness encoding.

*Semantics implementation note:*
The experiment is implemented with hybrid semantics. Graph topology and dependencies are discrete. Loads, capacities, and cascade statistics are treated as real valued quantities.

*Boundary note:*
Falsifying TU encoding is not the same as solving the canonical statement. This experiment only tests whether a particular encoding of multilayer robustness behaves coherently on synthetic models in the chosen class.

### Experiment 2: single layer heuristics versus multilayer reality

*Goal:*
Measure how often simple single layer robustness indicators underestimate or overestimate cascade risk when applied to multilayer networks, and test whether `DeltaS_cascade` and `DeltaS_multi` detect this systematically.

*Setup:*

* Choose a second synthetic model class `M_syn2(e_multi)` where:

  * layer structures are easy to analyze by single layer graph metrics
  * interlayer dependencies introduce couplings that can create cascades

* Choose a library of single layer heuristic scores `H_layer` such as:

  * average degree
  * algebraic connectivity
  * percolation threshold estimates

*Protocol:*

1. For each `m` in `M_syn2(e_multi)` and each layer `ell`, compute single layer heuristic scores `h(m; ell)` from `H_layer`.

2. Use `h(m; ell)` to form a single layer based robustness prediction `R_pred(m)` for the whole system, using a fixed recipe chosen before the experiment.

3. Independently compute `R_cascade(m)` using `CascadeMap` and the fixed shock pattern library.

4. Compute:

   * `DeltaS_cascade(m)` from disagreement between `R_simple(m)` and `R_cascade(m)`
   * `DeltaS_multi(m)` from disagreement between layer wise scores and global cascade behavior

5. Collect statistics over `M_syn2(e_multi)`.

*Metrics:*

* Frequency with which `R_pred(m)` and `R_cascade(m)` disagree by more than a fixed tolerance `tau_disagree`, where `tau_disagree` is chosen from a finite threshold set before the experiment.
* Distribution of `DeltaS_cascade(m)` and `DeltaS_multi(m)` on these high disagreement cases.
* Correlation between large mismatches and structural features from `StructProfile` and `InterdepProfile`.

*Falsification conditions:*

The encoding `e_multi` fails this test if:

1. There exists a subset of states with measure at least `rho_min` in the sample, where `R_pred(m)` and `R_cascade(m)` disagree beyond `tau_disagree`, but both `DeltaS_cascade(m)` and `DeltaS_multi(m)` remain below the low tension thresholds for almost all of these states.
2. Or, conversely, `DeltaS_cascade(m)` and `DeltaS_multi(m)` exceed high tension thresholds for most states, independent of any real structural mismatch, so that the encoding becomes too blunt to distinguish genuine robustness gaps from normal variation.

Here `rho_min` and `tau_disagree` are fixed in advance from finite sets specified by the tension scale charter.

*Semantics implementation note:*
Hybrid semantics are used. Topology is discrete, while robustness scores and mismatch values are treated as real numbers computed from simulation output.

*Boundary note:*
Falsifying TU encoding is not solving the canonical statement. This experiment tests the usefulness of the mismatch observables, not any ultimate theory of real world robustness.

## 7. AI and WFGY engineering spec

This block describes how Q106 can be used inside AI systems within the WFGY framework, at the effective layer, without exposing any deep TU generative rule.

### 7.1 Training signals

For a model that can internally represent multilayer systems, Q106 supports the following training signals.

1. `signal_multilayer_robustness_gap`

   * Definition: a scalar proportional to `Tension_multi(m; e_multi)` computed from internal representations of a described networked system.
   * Purpose: encourage the model to maintain internal states where naive and cascade based robustness assessments agree when they should, and to recognize when they diverge.

2. `signal_layer_dependency_consistency`

   * Definition: a signal derived from `InterdepProfile(m)` and `CascadeMap(m; shock_pattern, r)` that penalizes internal representations which ignore strong dependencies that clearly affect cascades.
   * Purpose: push the model to keep track of which layers depend on which others when reasoning about robustness.

3. `signal_cascade_tail_awareness`

   * Definition: a signal that increases when the model proposes or accepts configurations where small shocks lead to very large cascade outcomes, relative to single layer metrics.
   * Purpose: train the model to recognize potential heavy tail risks in multilayer systems and to treat them as exceptional rather than normal.

4. `signal_counterfactual_multi_worlds`

   * Definition: a pair of signals that measure how distinctly the model separates World T and World F style scenarios when prompted explicitly.
   * Purpose: ensure the model does not mix statements that assume high robustness with statements that imply unavoidable fragility in the same scenario.

### 7.2 Architectural patterns

Q106 suggests a few reusable architectural modules.

1. `MultilayerRobustnessHead`

   * Role: given an internal embedding that encodes a described multilayer system, this head outputs:

     * an estimated `R_simple`
     * an estimated `R_cascade`
     * an estimated `Tension_multi`

   * Interface: inputs are representations of nodes, layers, loads, capacities, and dependencies; outputs are a small set of robustness scores and mismatch quantities.

2. `CascadeScenarioFilter`

   * Role: evaluates whether a proposed scenario or design change is likely to move the system into high or low tension regimes.
   * Interface: input is a description of structural modifications or policy changes; output is a classification as likely safe, marginal, or fragile based on `Tension_multi` and mismatch terms.

3. `TU_MultiLayerField_Observer`

   * Role: generic observer that extracts simplified versions of `StructProfile`, `InterdepProfile`, and cascade summaries from large model internal states.
   * Interface: acts as a probe that maps intermediate embeddings to the summary space used by Q106, without requiring any bottom level TU generative rule.

### 7.3 Evaluation harness

We outline an evaluation harness for AI systems augmented with Q106 components.

1. Task design

   * Construct a benchmark of scenarios that describe multilayer infrastructures, financial systems, or social structures.
   * For each scenario, construct reference labels such as:

     * qualitatively robust
     * borderline
     * fragile

     based on separate domain models or expert assessments.

2. Conditions

   * Baseline condition: the AI model answers questions about robustness without Q106 modules or signals.
   * TU condition: the AI model uses Q106 modules and training signals as auxiliary guidance.

3. Metrics

   * Accuracy: agreement of robustness classifications with reference labels.
   * Consistency: frequency of contradictions across multiple related questions about the same scenario.
   * Sensitivity: ability to detect changes in robustness when small structural modifications are made in the prompt.

### 7.4 60 second reproduction protocol

A simple protocol for external observers to see the impact of Q106 style reasoning.

* Baseline setup

  * Prompt: present a short description of a multilayer infrastructure system and ask the AI to discuss its robustness under attacks and failures.
  * Observation: check whether the answer mentions interlayer dependencies, cascade risk, and the possibility that simple metrics can fail.

* TU encoded setup

  * Prompt: present the same description but ask the AI to reason explicitly in terms of:

    * multilayer structure
    * difference between naive metrics and cascade behavior
    * a conceptual `Tension_multi` score and its mismatch components

  * Observation: check whether the answer is more explicit about where robustness claims might fail and how cross layer couplings change risk.

* Comparison metric

  * Rate answers for:

    * structural clarity
    * explicit mention of tail risk
    * recognition of hidden dependencies

* What to log

  * Prompts and responses in both setups.
  * Any auxiliary `Tension_multi` estimates output by the MultilayerRobustnessHead.
  * Logs are sufficient for external audit at the effective layer.

## 9. TU roadmap and verification levels

### 9.1 Current levels

* E_level: E1

  * The effective layer encoding for Q106 has well defined:

    * state space structure
    * observables
    * mismatch quantities
    * tension functional
    * singular set and domain restriction
    * experiments with explicit falsification conditions

  * Experiments have been specified conceptually but not yet implemented and published as reproducible artefacts for this entry.

* N_level: N2

  * The narrative that links multilayer topology, cascade behavior, and robustness tension is explicit and coherent.
  * Counterfactual worlds and reuse relationships are laid out within the TU effective layer language.

### 9.2 Next measurable step toward E2

To reach E2, the following measurable steps are proposed.

1. Implement at least one synthetic experiment from Block 6 in a concrete model class for multilayer networks.

2. Publish:

   * the synthetic model class specification
   * code or detailed pseudocode for `CascadeMap`, `R_simple`, `R_cascade`, and the mismatch observables
   * tension distributions and mismatch statistics for a documented set of synthetic networks across a range of parameters

3. Demonstrate at least one downstream reuse, for example by integrating `RobustnessGapFunctional` into a Q105 crash prediction experiment with published results.

All of these steps operate at the effective layer and do not require any deep TU generative rule.

### 9.3 Long term role in the TU program

In the long term, Q106 is expected to serve as:

* the anchor for risk_tail_tension in complex networked systems
* a common language for talking about robustness gaps across domains such as infrastructure, finance, and social systems
* a template for encoding other complex socio technical problems where naive metrics and real failure modes diverge

Progress on Q106 will also inform how TU treats limits of robustness in AI alignment, Anthropocene dynamics, and other S level problems that reuse multilayer structures.

## 10. Elementary but precise explanation

This block explains Q106 in simple language while keeping the effective layer view.

Many systems today are not just single networks. A city, for example, has:

* a power grid
* communication networks
* transportation networks
* organizations and rules

These layers depend on each other. If power fails, communication may fail. If communication fails, repair teams may not move. If rules fail, nobody knows who should act.

People often ask how robust such a system is. A common habit is to look at simple statistics, like how many connections each node has or how big the largest cluster is. That can work in single layer networks. In multilayer systems this habit can be misleading.

In the Tension Universe view, Q106 asks a focused question:

* When do simple metrics say that the system is safe while the true behavior under shocks is fragile.
* Can we define a number `Tension_multi` that is small when simple metrics are trustworthy and large when they are not.

To do this we imagine a space of states. Each state describes:

* layers and connections in each layer
* how layers depend on each other
* how much load and capacity each part has
* which parts are already damaged

For each state we compute:

1. Simple robustness from local structure and per layer views.
2. Robustness from simulated cascades in which we remove some nodes and see how failures spread.

We then measure three mismatches:

* how far the structure is from a reference pattern that we consider balanced
* how much simple robustness and cascade robustness disagree
* how much per layer robustness and global robustness disagree

We combine these into one tension number `Tension_multi`. If `Tension_multi` is small, simple metrics are telling a mostly true story. If `Tension_multi` is large, there is a robustness gap and the system may be much more fragile than it looks.

We then consider two types of worlds, always relative to fixed encoding choices:

* In a World T type situation, engineers can design multilayer systems that keep `Tension_multi` low across many realistic scenarios. Simple metrics and cascades agree most of the time.
* In a World F type situation, no matter how people adjust structure inside realistic limits, there is always a high tension gap. Coupling between layers makes fragility hard to avoid.

Q106 does not claim which type of world we live in for any specific domain. It does something more basic. It gives:

* a clear way to talk about robustness gaps
* observable quantities that encode those gaps
* experiments and AI modules that use these quantities in a controlled way

This is enough for Q106 to be a central node for multilayer robustness in the Tension Universe framework and a starting point for many more detailed models and tests.

## Tension Universe effective layer footer

This page is part of the WFGY / Tension Universe S problem collection and should be interpreted strictly at the TU effective layer.

### Scope of claims

* The goal of this document is to specify an effective layer encoding of Q106, not to prove or disprove the canonical robustness problem.
* It does not introduce any new theorem beyond what is already established in the cited literature.
* It should not be cited as evidence that the corresponding open problem has been solved or that any particular real world system has been fully characterized.

### Effective layer boundary

* All objects in this document, including state spaces, encodings, observables, mismatch quantities, tension scores, counterfactual worlds, and AI facing modules, live at the effective layer.
* No bottom level generative rules, physical equations, or hidden TU axioms are exposed here.
* Any implementation that maps raw data into these objects must respect this boundary and should be specified in separate engineering documents.

### Encoding and fairness conventions

* Encodings in `E_enc_multi` are defined by finite libraries, fixed weights, and fixed threshold sets chosen before any experiments.
* Experiments in Block 6 test these encodings under synthetic model classes. Passing or failing is attached to a specific encoding.
* Changing libraries, weights, or threshold sets defines a new encoding and requires a separate evaluation.
* Falsifying a TU encoding is not the same as proving impossibility for real systems.

### Engineering and AI use

* The AI facing specification in Block 7 describes how Q106 can be used as a modular component for reasoning about robustness in multilayer systems.
* These uses are optional and must always be labeled as effective layer tools, not as guarantees about real world safety.
* External users should keep the separation between baseline responses and TU guided responses clear when running reproduction protocols.

This page should be read together with the following charters:

* [TU Effective Layer Charter](../Charters/TU_EFFECTIVE_LAYER_CHARTER.md)
* [TU Encoding and Fairness Charter](../Charters/TU_ENCODING_AND_FAIRNESS_CHARTER.md)
* [TU Tension Scale Charter](../Charters/TU_TENSION_SCALE_CHARTER.md)
* [TU Global Guardrails](../Charters/TU_GLOBAL_GUARDRAILS.md)

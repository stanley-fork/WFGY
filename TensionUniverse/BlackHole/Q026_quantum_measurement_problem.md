## 0. Effective layer disclaimer

All statements in this Q026 entry are made strictly at the **effective layer** of the Tension Universe (TU) framework.

* This page specifies an effective layer encoding of the **quantum measurement problem**, in terms of:

  * state spaces,
  * observables and mismatch functionals,
  * tension functionals,
  * singular sets and domain restrictions,
  * falsifiable experiments over encodings.

* This page **does not**:

  * introduce any new axiom system for quantum mechanics or TU,
  * define any deep TU generative rule,
  * give any constructive mapping from raw laboratory data or Hilbert space models to internal TU fields,
  * prove or disprove any existing interpretation or dynamical modification of quantum theory.

* All mappings of the form:

  * concrete experiment or thought experiment
    → abstract measurement configuration `m` in `M_meas`
    → numerical values for observables and tension
    are delegated to external implementations that respect the encoding contracts defined here.

* The tension quantities defined in this document (for example `DeltaS_unitary_vs_outcome`, `DeltaS_Born_consistency`, `Tension_QM_MEAS`) are **bookkeeping and diagnostic tools** at the effective layer. They are not physical observables by themselves and are not claimed to represent any new measurable field.

* This page must not be cited as evidence that the quantum measurement problem has been solved, that any specific interpretation is correct, or that any particular collapse model is experimentally validated. It only defines how TU encodes and scores the tension for Q026.

## 1. Canonical problem and status

### 1.1 Canonical statement

In standard quantum theory, a physical system is represented by a state vector or density operator and evolves in time through a linear, unitary law. Measurements are described by observables or more general positive operator valued measures, and outcome probabilities are given by the Born rule.

The quantum measurement problem arises from the following tension.

1. The dynamics of the combined system of measured object, apparatus, and environment is assumed to be exactly unitary.
2. Actual experiments yield single, definite outcomes, recorded in macroscopic apparatus states, with frequencies that follow the Born rule.
3. If one applies strict unitary evolution to the combined system, the result is an entangled superposition of distinct outcome branches, not a single definite record.

The canonical question is:

> How can a strictly unitary quantum dynamics of system plus apparatus plus environment give rise to single, definite measurement outcomes with Born rule statistics, without introducing vague or inconsistent additional postulates?

This is the form of the quantum measurement problem encoded in Q026.

### 1.2 Status and difficulty

The problem is open in the sense that there is no consensus solution that is both precise and widely accepted.

Main families of responses include:

* **Interpretational strategies**

  Many worlds, relational, and informational interpretations attempt to show that unitary evolution plus additional interpretive rules already suffice to explain outcomes, without modifying the Schrödinger equation.

* **Dynamical modification strategies**

  Spontaneous collapse models and related proposals modify the Schrödinger equation to produce actual collapses with suitable rates that depend on mass, complexity, or other parameters.

* **Decoherence based strategies**

  Decoherence explains the effective suppression of interference between macroscopically distinct branches through entanglement with the environment. On its own it does not select a single outcome, but it clarifies how classical looking records emerge in practice.

None of these strategies has unambiguous experimental confirmation or clear conceptual dominance. The measurement problem remains a central open tension in quantum foundations and at the interface between quantum theory and macroscopic experience.

### 1.3 Role in the BlackHole project

Within the BlackHole S problem collection, Q026 plays three roles.

1. Q026 is the reference node for **consistency_tension** in quantum theory, where an elegant microscopic law coexists with apparently incompatible macroscopic facts.

2. Q026 provides a template for encoding conflicts between different descriptions of the same process in TU, especially between:

   * unitary descriptions of quantum evolution, and
   * outcome based descriptions in terms of definite records and probabilities.

3. Q026 serves as a source of reusable components for any problem that treats quantum experiments, decoherence, or observer like subsystems as part of a larger system, including parts of physics, neuroscience, and AI interpretability.

## 2. Position in the BlackHole graph

This block records how Q026 sits inside the BlackHole graph over Q001 to Q125. Each edge is listed with a one line reason that points to a concrete component or tension type. All edges are defined at the effective layer and do not imply shared axioms or joint encodings.

### 2.1 Upstream problems

These problems provide prerequisites or general frameworks that Q026 reuses.

### 2.3 Parallel problems

Parallel nodes share similar tension types but no direct component dependence.

* Q021 (BH_PHYS_QG_L3_021)

## 3. Tension Universe encoding (effective layer)

All content in this block is at the effective layer. We only describe:

* state spaces,
* fields and observables,
* mismatch functionals and invariants,
* singular sets and domain restrictions,
* embedding into TU tension tensors.

We do not describe any deep TU generative rules, any axiom systems, or any constructive mapping from raw laboratory data or Hilbert spaces to internal TU fields.

### 3.1 State space

We posit an effective measurement configuration space

```txt
M_meas
```

with the following interpretation at the effective layer.

* Each element `m` in `M_meas` represents a coherent measurement scenario configuration, including:

  * a quantum system with a Hilbert space and an initial state,
  * a measurement apparatus with pointer degrees of freedom,
  * a relevant environment sector that can influence decoherence,
  * a coarse description of the outcome record as read at the classical level.

For each `m` in `M_meas`, the encoding is required to support:

* a description of unitary evolution of system plus apparatus plus environment, and
* an effective probability distribution over macroscopic pointer outcomes that can be compared with data.

We do not specify how such configurations are generated from microscopic models or experiments. We only assume that, for each experiment or thought experiment in the Q026 scope, there exist one or more states `m` in `M_meas` that encode its effective properties.

### 3.2 Fields and observables

We introduce the following effective observables on `M_meas`. All observable values belong to continuous spaces such as real intervals or real valued function spaces. Discrete labels (for example outcome labels) are treated as indices and do not introduce a separate semantic type, which is why the metadata keeps `Semantics: continuous`.

1. Full quantum state observable

```txt
psi_full(m; t)
```

* Input: a state `m` and a time parameter `t` in a chosen interval.
* Output: an abstract label for the combined quantum state of system plus apparatus plus environment at time `t`.
* Role: used only to express properties of unitary evolution; no explicit Hilbert space representation is required in this document.

2. Outcome probability observable

```txt
P_outcome(m; o)
```

* Input: a state `m` and an outcome label `o` from a finite or countable index set of outcomes.
* Output: a number in the interval `[0, 1]`, representing the effective probability of outcome `o` as encoded in `m`.
* Role: captures the outcome statistics according to the rule built into the encoding, which may coincide with the Born rule or a modification.

3. Branch coherence observable

```txt
C_branch(m)
```

* Input: a state `m`.
* Output: a nonnegative scalar that summarizes the degree of mutual coherence between macroscopically distinct pointer branches.
* Role: low `C_branch(m)` indicates strong decoherence between outcome branches at the effective layer.

4. Outcome record observable

```txt
R_record(m)
```

* Input: a state `m`.
* Output: an abstract representation of the macroscopic outcome record, such as a pointer position or digital readout, that can be treated as classical data.
* Role: connects measurement scenarios in `M_meas` to classical statements and records.

### 3.3 Mismatch observables

We define mismatch observables that quantify key aspects of the measurement problem.

1. Unitary versus outcome mismatch

```txt
DeltaS_unitary_vs_outcome(m) >= 0
```

* Measures how strongly the strictly unitary description of `psi_full(m; t)` conflicts with the existence of a single definite outcome record represented by `R_record(m)`.
* A value near zero means that, for the configuration represented by `m`, there is no effective conflict between unitary evolution and outcome definiteness at the considered scale.
* Larger values correspond to configurations where the unitary description leads to significant weight on multiple macroscopically distinct outcomes that are all encoded as live possibilities.

2. Born rule consistency mismatch

```txt
DeltaS_Born_consistency(m) >= 0
```

* Measures the deviation between the encoded outcome probabilities `P_outcome(m; o)` and frequencies or constraints that would follow from the Born rule for the same scenario.
* A value near zero means that outcome frequencies or probabilities match Born rule expectations within the chosen tolerance.
* Larger values indicate systematic deviations from Born rule statistics.

3. Combined measurement mismatch

We define a combined nonnegative scalar:

```txt
DeltaS_QM_MEAS(m) =
  w_unit * DeltaS_unitary_vs_outcome(m)
+ w_Born * DeltaS_Born_consistency(m)
```

where `w_unit` and `w_Born` are fixed positive weights that belong to the encoding element identified by `EncodingKey_Q026` and `WeightKey_Q026`. They satisfy:

```txt
w_unit > 0
w_Born > 0
w_unit + w_Born = 1
```

For a given encoding element, these weights are chosen once and applied to all scenarios in that analysis run.

### 3.4 Invariants

We define simple invariants that summarize mismatch behavior across families of scenarios.

1. Outcome consistency invariant

```txt
I_outcome(m) =
  sup over o in Outcomes | P_outcome(m; o) - P_ref(m; o) |
```

where `P_ref(m; o)` is a reference probability assignment for the same scenario, for example the Born rule probabilities computed from the encoded initial state and measurement operators. The choice of `P_ref` belongs to the encoding element identified by `LibraryKey_ref_Q026`.

2. Decoherence support invariant

```txt
I_decoh(m) = C_branch(m)
```

interpreted as a scalar summarizing how strongly decoherence has suppressed interference between pointer branches for the scenario represented by `m`. For many measurement scenarios we expect that low `I_decoh(m)` is a necessary condition for effective classical outcomes, but not sufficient to resolve the entire measurement problem.

These invariants are effective layer tools for diagnosing how severe the measurement tension is for each configuration. They are not claimed to be fundamental quantities in any microscopic theory.

### 3.5 Singular set and domain restriction

Some configurations may fail to provide a coherent or well defined measurement scenario. We collect them in a singular set:

```txt
S_sing_meas =
  { m in M_meas :
    P_outcome(m; o) is undefined for some o
    or sum over o P_outcome(m; o) differs from 1
       by more than tol_prob_QM_MEAS
    or R_record(m) cannot be consistently read
       as a single outcome record
    or DeltaS_QM_MEAS(m) is undefined or not finite
  }
```

Here `tol_prob_QM_MEAS` is a small positive tolerance parameter for probability normalization. Its value belongs to the encoding element identified by `EncodingKey_Q026` and must be specified before any experiments are scored.

We restrict analysis to the regular domain:

```txt
M_reg_meas = M_meas \ S_sing_meas
```

and adopt the following rules.

* If an experiment or thought experiment produces configurations that would fall into `S_sing_meas` under a given encoding, those configurations are treated as out of domain for that encoding and do not directly count as evidence about the physical world.

* If a candidate encoding sends a large fraction of physically relevant scenarios into `S_sing_meas`, that encoding can be rejected as ineffective at the effective layer, using the experiments in Block 6.

### 3.6 Embedding into TU tension tensor

For bookkeeping across the TU program, Q026 is associated with a sector level tension tensor

```txt
T_ij_QM_MEAS(m) =
  S_i_QM(m) * C_j_QM(m) * Tension_QM_MEAS(m) * lambda_QM(m) * kappa_QM_MEAS
```

where:

* `S_i_QM(m)` and `C_j_QM(m)` are source and receptivity factors attached to quantum measurement sectors at the effective layer.
* `Tension_QM_MEAS(m)` is the scalar tension functional defined in Block 4.
* `lambda_QM(m)` is a dimensionless scaling factor that can depend on scenario complexity but is fixed by the encoding element.
* `kappa_QM_MEAS` is a constant normalization factor assigned to Q026 as a sector, also fixed by the encoding element.

The precise choices of `S_i_QM`, `C_j_QM`, `lambda_QM`, and `kappa_QM_MEAS` belong to the encoding element identified by `EncodingKey_Q026` and `WeightKey_Q026`. This embedding does not introduce any new axiom or physical field. It only records the position of Q026 within the TU tension bookkeeping structure.

---

## 4. Tension principle for this problem

This block states how Q026 is characterized as a tension problem within TU at the effective layer.

### 4.1 Core tension functional

We define an effective measurement tension functional:

```txt
Tension_QM_MEAS(m) = F(
  DeltaS_unitary_vs_outcome(m),
  DeltaS_Born_consistency(m)
)
```

where `F` is a fixed nonnegative function on pairs of nonnegative scalars. A simple admissible choice is:

```txt
Tension_QM_MEAS(m) =
  a * DeltaS_unitary_vs_outcome(m)
  + b * DeltaS_Born_consistency(m)
```

with constants `a > 0` and `b > 0`. More generally, `F` must satisfy:

* `Tension_QM_MEAS(m) >= 0` for all `m` in `M_reg_meas`,
* `Tension_QM_MEAS(m)` is small when both mismatch terms are small,
* `Tension_QM_MEAS(m)` grows when either mismatch term grows.

For a given encoding element in `A_enc_QM_MEAS`, the function `F` and the constants `a`, `b` are determined by `WeightKey_Q026` and remain fixed across all scenarios considered in that analysis.

### 4.2 Admissible encoding class and fairness constraint

We restrict attention to an admissible encoding class

```txt
A_enc_QM_MEAS
```

for Q026. Each element of this class is an encoding

```txt
E_QM_MEAS ∈ A_enc_QM_MEAS
```

specified by:

* choices of weights `a`, `b`, `w_unit`, `w_Born`,
* choices of reference probabilities `P_ref(m; o)` and probability normalization tolerance `tol_prob_QM_MEAS`,
* choices of low tension band `[0, epsilon_meas]`,
* choices of high tension thresholds `delta_meas` and optional hard failure level `T_fail_QM_MEAS`,
* choices of sector scaling parameters in the tensor embedding (`lambda_QM`, `kappa_QM_MEAS`),
* any additional thresholds used in experiments, such as a probability level `p_near_1_QM_MEAS` for "almost certain" outcomes.

The metadata fields `EncodingKey_Q026`, `LibraryKey_ref_Q026`, and `WeightKey_Q026` identify a particular encoding element `E_QM_MEAS` inside `A_enc_QM_MEAS`.

**Fairness constraint**

To avoid trivial tuning that would hide the tension:

* For any analysis run, the encoding element `E_QM_MEAS` must be specified and fixed **before** looking at the detailed pattern of outcomes or thought experiment conclusions to be evaluated.

* For that run, all parameters in `E_QM_MEAS` (weights, reference distributions, tolerances, thresholds) are held fixed across all tested scenarios and cannot be adjusted in response to individual experiment results.

* Changing any of these parameters defines a new encoding element and must be accompanied by a new `EncodingKey_Q026` and possibly a new `WeightKey_Q026` or `LibraryKey_ref_Q026`.

These rules instantiate, for Q026, the general requirements of the TU Encoding and Fairness Charter.

### 4.3 Measurement problem as low tension principle

At the effective layer, the quantum measurement problem can be phrased as the following low tension principle.

> Is there a single coherent encoding of measurement, based on unitary dynamics plus any additional rules allowed in the chosen interpretive or dynamical framework, such that for all physically relevant measurement scenarios, the effective measurement tension `Tension_QM_MEAS(m)` can be kept within a small and stable band?

Concretely, for any encoding element `E_QM_MEAS` in `A_enc_QM_MEAS` that claims to solve or resolve the measurement problem:

* There should exist states `m_world` in `M_reg_meas` that represent actual measurement scenarios in the world, such that:

```txt
Tension_QM_MEAS(m_world) <= epsilon_meas
```

for a small threshold `epsilon_meas` determined by `E_QM_MEAS` and recorded in `WeightKey_Q026`.

* As more precise data and more challenging scenarios are added to the test suite associated with `LibraryKey_ref_Q026`, the required `epsilon_meas` should not need to grow without bound to keep the encoding viable.

### 4.4 Measurement failure as persistent high tension

If the measurement problem remains unresolved within a given encoding class, then we expect:

* There exist families of scenarios, including thought experiments and real experiments, whose corresponding states `m_fail` in `M_reg_meas` satisfy:

```txt
Tension_QM_MEAS(m_fail) >= delta_meas
```

with `delta_meas > 0` that cannot be reduced by any refinement of the scenarios or models that remains inside the same encoding element `E_QM_MEAS`.

* Attempting to reduce `Tension_QM_MEAS` for these scenarios by retuning the encoding parameters would require leaving `E_QM_MEAS` and changing `EncodingKey_Q026`, which counts as moving to a different encoding rather than resolving the tension inside the original one.

At the effective layer, Q026 does not assert that such a resolution or failure exists. Instead, it sets up `Tension_QM_MEAS` as the main diagnostic that later experiments and conceptual analyses can use to test claims about measurement.

---

## 5. Counterfactual tension worlds

We outline two counterfactual worlds, both described strictly at the effective layer.

* World T: measurement tension can be made small and stable across all relevant scenarios in a single coherent encoding element.
* World F: measurement tension cannot be reduced below a positive lower bound across all relevant scenarios within any encoding element in the admissible class.

These worlds are tools for testing encodings. They are not metaphysical assertions about the actual world.

### 5.1 World T (well resolved measurement world)

In World T:

1. There exist encoding elements `E_QM_MEAS` in `A_enc_QM_MEAS` and states `m_T` in `M_reg_meas` representing a large class of actual measurement scenarios, such that:

```txt
Tension_QM_MEAS(m_T) <= epsilon_meas
```

with a small `epsilon_meas` that remains stable as more complex experiments are included.

2. Decoherence, coarse graining, interpretive rules, or explicit dynamical modifications provide a clear and consistent path from `psi_full(m_T; t)` to definite outcome records `R_record(m_T)` for all these scenarios, in a way that is captured by the mismatch observables and tension functional.

3. Different descriptions of the same physical setup, for example from different observer perspectives, yield compatible outcome records and similar low tension values when encoded as elements of `M_reg_meas`.

4. Thought experiments such as Wigner friend style scenarios can be represented within the same encoding element without leading to contradictions between outcome stories or probability assignments.

### 5.2 World F (inescapable measurement tension world)

In World F:

1. For every encoding element `E_QM_MEAS` in `A_enc_QM_MEAS` that attempts to represent all standard measurement scenarios, there exist configurations `m_F` in `M_reg_meas` for which:

```txt
Tension_QM_MEAS(m_F) >= delta_meas
```

with `delta_meas > 0`, and this lower bound cannot be reduced by further refinement of the scenarios within that encoding.

2. Some thought experiments, such as Wigner friend variations, exhibit incompatible outcome records or probability assignments when different parts of the setup are described within the same encoding element, leading to systematically high `DeltaS_unitary_vs_outcome(m_F)` or `DeltaS_Born_consistency(m_F)`.

3. Attempting to restrict the domain to avoid contradictions leads to many physically relevant scenarios being pushed into `S_sing_meas`, so that the remaining regular domain no longer covers realistic measurement practice.

4. Interference experiments with increasingly macroscopic systems reveal patterns that cannot be made compatible with any fixed assignment of decoherence or collapse parameters allowed by the admissible class, keeping `Tension_QM_MEAS` high.

### 5.3 Interpretive note

These counterfactual worlds are defined only in terms of effective observables and tension functionals. They do not describe or assume any deep TU generative rule. They provide a structured way to talk about what it would mean, at the effective layer, for a proposed measurement resolution to succeed or fail in the Q026 encoding.

---

## 6. Falsifiability and discriminating experiments

This block specifies experiments and protocols that can:

* test whether particular encoding elements in `A_enc_QM_MEAS` are effective or ineffective for Q026,
* discriminate between different measurement tension models,
* provide concrete evidence for or against specific parameter choices.

These experiments do not solve the measurement problem, but they can falsify particular encodings at the effective layer.

Throughout this block, all tension values are computed only for states in `M_reg_meas`. Any scenario that maps into `S_sing_meas` for a given encoding is treated as out of domain for that encoding in that run.

### Experiment 1: Mesoscopic interference and collapse scale

**Goal**

Test whether an encoding that uses only unitary dynamics plus decoherence, or an encoding that adds objective collapse, can keep measurement tension within an acceptable band over a wide range of interference experiments with increasing system size.

**Setup**

* Select a family of interference experiments with particles or composite objects of increasing mass and complexity, including setups close to existing and planned mesoscopic interference tests.
* For each experiment, identify:

  * the relevant superposition and path separation,
  * the environment coupling parameters needed for decoherence based models,
  * the collapse rate parameters for objective collapse models in the admissible encoding class.

**Protocol**

1. For each experiment in the family, define a state `m_data` in `M_reg_meas` that encodes:

   * the predicted interference visibility under pure unitary plus decoherence,
   * the predicted visibility under a given collapse model,
   * the observed or expected visibility with uncertainties.

2. Compute `DeltaS_unitary_vs_outcome(m_data)` by comparing:

   * the unitary plus decoherence prediction for fringe visibility, and
   * the actual presence or absence of visible interference in the pointer degrees of freedom.

3. Compute `DeltaS_Born_consistency(m_data)` by comparing the observed frequencies of outcomes in the interference pattern with the predicted ones, under each encoding element `E_QM_MEAS`.

4. For each encoding element `E_QM_MEAS`, compute `Tension_QM_MEAS(m_data)` across the entire family of experiments using the fixed function `F` and weights identified by `WeightKey_Q026`.

5. Study how `Tension_QM_MEAS(m_data)` varies as system size, decoherence parameters, and collapse parameters change, while remaining inside the parameter ranges allowed by `E_QM_MEAS`.

**Metrics**

* For each encoding element:

  * maximum `Tension_QM_MEAS(m_data)` across the experiment family,
  * number of experiments that exceed the low tension band `[0, epsilon_meas]`,
  * stability of tension values under small changes in parameters allowed within `E_QM_MEAS`.

**Falsification conditions**

Encoding elements are tested using thresholds that belong to `E_QM_MEAS`:

* `epsilon_meas > 0` is the upper limit of the low tension band.
* `delta_meas > 0` is a high tension threshold that marks persistent tension.
* Optionally, `T_fail_QM_MEAS > delta_meas` is a hard failure level beyond which the encoding is considered unusable for that experiment family.

Conditions:

* If, for every allowed choice of parameters in a given encoding element, at least one experiment in the family produces:

  ```txt
  Tension_QM_MEAS(m_data) >= delta_meas
  ```

  then that encoding element is considered falsified at the effective layer for this experiment family.

* If an encoding element predicts systematic deviations in interference visibility that lie outside the experimental uncertainty ranges for many systems, and this is reflected in multiple `Tension_QM_MEAS(m_data)` values exceeding `T_fail_QM_MEAS`, while an alternative encoding element in `A_enc_QM_MEAS` keeps `Tension_QM_MEAS` within the low tension band for all systems, then the first encoding element is rejected for Q026 and the second is retained for further testing.

**Semantics implementation note**

All states, probabilities, and tension values are treated in the continuous field sense declared in the metadata. Discrete outcome labels are used only as indices.

**Boundary note**

Falsifying a Q026 encoding element in this experiment does not by itself solve or refute the measurement problem. It only rejects that specific effective layer encoding for this experiment family.

---

### Experiment 2: Wigner friend style consistency tests

**Goal**

Probe whether an encoding element can assign consistent outcome records and probabilities across nested measurement scenarios that include observer like subsystems.

**Setup**

* Consider a family of thought experiments where:

  * a "friend" measures a quantum system inside a closed laboratory,
  * an external observer later performs a measurement that treats the friend and system as a single quantum object,
  * classical records are read by both the friend and the external observer.

* For each scenario, formulate outcome labels for:

  * the friend's record,
  * the external observer's record,
  * any joint statements about their records.

**Protocol**

1. For each scenario, define a state `m_friend` in `M_reg_meas` that encodes:

   * the unitary evolution of system plus friend plus apparatus,
   * the outcome probabilities according to the encoding element under test,
   * the classical records as seen by each agent.

2. Compute `DeltaS_unitary_vs_outcome(m_friend)` by measuring how far a single unitary description can accommodate all outcome records without contradiction.

3. Compute `DeltaS_Born_consistency(m_friend)` by checking whether outcome probabilities for each agent and for joint statements obey the Born rule or the encoding element's modification.

4. Evaluate `Tension_QM_MEAS(m_friend)` for each scenario and encoding element in `A_enc_QM_MEAS`.

5. Examine logical consistency: whether there exist combinations of records with probability close to one according to different parts of the encoding that cannot all be true together.

**Metrics**

* For each encoding element:

  * maximum `Tension_QM_MEAS(m_friend)` across the thought experiment family,
  * number of scenarios where logical inconsistencies in outcome records appear,
  * sensitivity of tension values to small changes in the description of the friend and external observer.

**Falsification conditions**

The encoding element contains a parameter `p_near_1_QM_MEAS` in `(0, 1)` that defines "almost certain" events, and the thresholds `epsilon_meas`, `delta_meas`, and optionally `T_fail_QM_MEAS`.

Conditions:

* If, for a given encoding element, there exists at least one thought experiment in the family where:

  * the encoding assigns probability at least `p_near_1_QM_MEAS` to each of two or more outcome descriptions that cannot all be true together, or
  * the encoding requires pushing the scenario into `S_sing_meas` in order to avoid inconsistency,
    then that encoding element is rejected at the effective layer for Q026.

* If an encoding element consistently yields low `Tension_QM_MEAS(m_friend)` and no logical contradictions across all such scenarios, it passes this particular falsification test and remains a candidate within `A_enc_QM_MEAS`.

**Semantics implementation note**

Agent states and outcome records are represented using the same continuous semantics as other quantum systems and apparatus. There is no additional discrete semantic layer introduced for agents.

**Boundary note**

Passing or failing these thought experiment tests does not prove or disprove quantum mechanics. It only evaluates the internal consistency of a Q026 effective layer encoding element.

## 7. AI and WFGY engineering spec

This block describes how Q026 can be used as an engineering module for AI systems within WFGY, at the effective layer.

### 7.1 Training signals

We outline training signals that encourage models to treat measurement scenarios consistently.

1. `signal_measurement_consistency`

   * Definition: a signal proportional to `Tension_QM_MEAS(m)` when the model generates or evaluates a quantum measurement narrative.
   * Purpose: penalize internal reasoning that treats unitary evolution, outcome records, and probabilities in mutually incompatible ways.

2. `signal_decoherence_alignment`

   * Definition: a signal that increases when the model relies on decoherence language to claim outcome definiteness but still leaves high `DeltaS_unitary_vs_outcome(m)`.
   * Purpose: encourage the model to distinguish clearly between effective decoherence and full measurement resolution.

3. `signal_counterfactual_separation`

   * Definition: a signal measuring how clearly the model keeps World T and World F style assumptions separated in its reasoning about measurement.
   * Purpose: penalize internal states that blur assumptions about low and high measurement tension worlds.

4. `signal_branch_coherence_control`

   * Definition: a signal derived from `C_branch(m)` and any direct references to interference between macroscopically distinct outcomes.
   * Purpose: encourage the model to represent branch coherence in a way that is compatible with the described measurement scheme.

### 7.2 Architectural patterns

We suggest module patterns that reuse Q026 structures without revealing any deep TU generative rules.

1. `QuantumOutcomeConsistencyHead`

   * Role: given an internal representation of a quantum measurement scenario, outputs an estimate of `Tension_QM_MEAS(m)` as an auxiliary diagnostic.
   * Interface: input is an embedding that represents the scenario; outputs are a scalar tension estimate and a short vector decomposing the mismatch into unitary versus outcome and Born rule parts.

2. `DecoherenceScenarioClassifier`

   * Role: classify parts of a quantum narrative as:

     * purely unitary plus decoherence based,
     * relying on implicit collapse,
     * using interpretive rules.
   * Interface: input is an internal representation of a reasoning trace; output is a small set of scores or labels that indicate which type of description is being used.

3. `MeasurementPatternSelector`

   * Role: map a natural language or formal description of an experiment into a standardized pattern from the Q026 measurement experiment library.
   * Interface: input is text or structured data; output is a reference to a pattern and a parameterization that can be used by the tension evaluation modules.

### 7.3 Evaluation harness

We outline an evaluation harness to compare models with and without Q026 derived modules.

1. Task selection

   * Collect problems and thought experiments from quantum foundations that involve measurement, decoherence, and outcome definiteness.
   * Include textbook exercises and conceptual questions that require clear explanations of the measurement problem.

2. Conditions

   * Baseline condition:

     * the model operates without `QuantumOutcomeConsistencyHead` and related signals.
   * TU condition:

     * the model uses Q026 derived modules and training signals during fine tuning or inference.

3. Metrics

   * Conceptual consistency:

     * frequency of internal contradictions in explanations about measurement.
   * Structural clarity:

     * how often the model clearly distinguishes between unitary evolution, decoherence, collapse, and interpretive elements.
   * Stability under rephrasing:

     * robustness of answers when prompts are varied but the underlying scenario is the same.

### 7.4 60 second reproduction protocol

A minimal protocol for external users to experience the effect of Q026 encoding.

* Baseline setup

  * Prompt the model to explain the quantum measurement problem, including how unitary evolution, decoherence, and collapse are related, without any mention of TU or WFGY.
  * Record whether the explanation is vague, contradictory, or conflates different solution proposals.

* TU encoded setup

  * Prompt the same model, but explicitly instruct it to organize its answer around:

    * unitary versus outcome mismatch,
    * Born rule consistency mismatch,
    * the idea of a measurement tension functional such as `Tension_QM_MEAS`.
  * Record whether the explanation becomes more structured and explicit about the different components of the problem.

* Comparison metric

  * Use a simple rubric to rate:

    * the presence of contradictions,
    * clarity of tension structure,
    * separation of interpretive and dynamical elements.
  * Compare scores between the baseline and TU conditions.

* What to log

  * Prompts, full responses, and any auxiliary tension scores produced by Q026 related modules.
  * These logs allow later analysis without revealing any deep TU generative rule.

## 8. Cross problem transfer template

This block describes the reusable components produced by Q026 and how they transfer to other problems.

### 8.1 Reusable components produced by this problem

1. ComponentName: `MeasurementConsistencyTension_Functional`

   * Type: functional
   * Minimal interface:

     * Inputs:

       * abstract summary of unitary evolution for a measurement scenario,
       * abstract summary of outcome records and probabilities.
     * Output:

       * nonnegative scalar `tension_value`.
   * Preconditions:

     * Inputs must encode a coherent measurement scenario that can be mapped to an element of `M_reg_meas`.

2. ComponentName: `MeasurementExperimentPattern_Library`

   * Type: experiment_pattern
   * Minimal interface:

     * Inputs:

       * high level description of a measurement experiment family, such as interference scale tests or Wigner friend style setups.
     * Output:

       * parameterized experiment patterns using the template of Block 6, including metrics and falsification conditions.
   * Preconditions:

     * The described experiments must admit a representation in terms of system, apparatus, and environment with identifiable outcome records.

3. ComponentName: `OutcomeRecordAbstraction_Descriptor`

   * Type: field
   * Minimal interface:

     * Inputs:

       * raw or symbolic description of apparatus readouts and observer reports.
     * Output:

       * a simplified representation compatible with `R_record(m)` and usable in other problems that involve outcome like events.
   * Preconditions:

     * The input description must be rich enough to distinguish macroscopically distinct outcomes.

### 8.2 Direct reuse targets

For each target problem, reuse is restricted to the effective layer pattern. Each target must define its own encoding class, keys, weights, and thresholds; it cannot reuse `EncodingKey_Q026` directly.

1. Q027 (BH_PHYS_DECOHERENCE_BOUND_L3_027)

   * Reused component:

     * `MeasurementConsistencyTension_Functional`.
   * Why it transfers:

     * Q027 compares decoherence only explanations with alternative mechanisms and needs a way to score how well each explanation produces definite outcomes.
   * What changes:

     * the focus is on how much of the tension can be reduced by decoherence alone, rather than by any broader encoding. Q027 has its own encoding class and keys.

2. Q034 (BH_PHYS_QCROSSOVER_L3_034)

   * Reused component:

     * `MeasurementExperimentPattern_Library`.
   * Why it transfers:

     * Q034 studies the transition from quantum to classical behavior, and measurement experiments are a primary source of test cases.
   * What changes:

     * Q034 emphasizes the scaling of tension with system size and environment coupling and may add additional observables for classicality. Its tension functional and thresholds are defined in its own encoding class.

3. Q123 (BH_AI_INTERP_L3_123)

   * Reused components:

     * `MeasurementConsistencyTension_Functional`,
     * `OutcomeRecordAbstraction_Descriptor`.
   * Why it transfers:

     * Q123 treats AI interpretability and probing of internal states as an effective measurement problem on the model and can reuse the measurement tension template.
   * What changes:

     * the physical apparatus is replaced by probes and logging tools, and outcome records become model outputs and internal activations. Q123 must define its own encoding class and keys.

## 9. TU roadmap and verification levels

This block explains how Q026 is positioned on the TU verification ladder and what the next measurable steps are.

### 9.1 Current levels

* E_level: E1

  * Q026 provides a coherent effective layer encoding of the measurement problem in terms of:

    * an explicit state space `M_meas`,
    * mismatch observables and a tension functional `Tension_QM_MEAS`,
    * a singular set `S_sing_meas` and domain restriction,
    * at least two concrete experiments with clear falsification conditions.

* N_level: N1

  * The narrative that links unitary dynamics, outcome definiteness, and Born rule consistency is explicit and internally coherent at the effective layer.
  * Counterfactual worlds World T and World F are defined in terms of observable tension patterns.

### 9.2 Next measurable step toward E2

To move from E1 to E2 for Q026, at least one of the following should be implemented and documented.

1. A working prototype that:

   * takes as input:

     * descriptions of simple measurement experiments or thought experiments,
   * maps them into elements of `M_reg_meas` under a specified encoding element `E_QM_MEAS`,
   * computes:

     * `DeltaS_unitary_vs_outcome`,
     * `DeltaS_Born_consistency`,
     * `Tension_QM_MEAS`,
   * and publishes the resulting tension profiles for a small benchmark suite associated with `LibraryKey_ref_Q026`.

2. A concrete instantiation of the admissible encoding class `A_enc_QM_MEAS`:

   * with explicit parameter ranges for weights and thresholds,
   * with a clear rule for refinement of experiments,
   * and with an open description of how encoding elements are selected before analysis.

Either step strengthens Q026 from a conceptual encoding to an operational tool.

### 9.3 Long term role in the TU program

In the long term, Q026 is expected to serve as:

* the reference node for consistency_tension in quantum foundations,
* a template for any problem where a clean microscopic theory collides with ambiguous or multi level macroscopic descriptions,
* a bridge between:

  * quantum experiments,
  * philosophy of physics,
  * AI systems that need to reason coherently about quantum measurement.

Progress on Q026 is not measured by solving the measurement problem, but by:

* how well Q026 encodings help evaluate proposed solutions,
* how much they reduce confusion and contradiction in reasoning about measurement,
* how effectively they integrate with other BlackHole nodes in physics, neuroscience, and AI.

## 10. Elementary but precise explanation

The quantum measurement problem can be stated in simple terms.

Quantum theory says that the state of a system evolves smoothly and reversibly according to a linear law. When you include the measuring device and the environment, the whole system should follow this same smooth evolution. Yet in the laboratory, we always see a single outcome. The pointer points to one value. A detector clicks in one channel, not in all of them at once.

The usual textbook rule for outcomes, the Born rule, tells us how likely each result is. But the theory does not tell us clearly how, or even whether, the smooth evolution turns into a single outcome at a definite time. Different interpretations and modified dynamics offer different answers, and they do not all agree.

In the Tension Universe view, Q026 does not try to decide which interpretation is correct. Instead, it asks a different kind of question.

* Can we define quantities that measure how severe the conflict is between:

  * the smooth, unitary description of the whole system, and
  * the story in which there is one clear outcome,
  * together with the Born rule for outcome frequencies?

* Can we define a measurement tension number that is small in a world where the problem is resolved, and large in a world where it is not?

To do this, Q026:

* imagines a space of measurement scenarios, each of which includes:

  * a system, an apparatus, an environment, and an outcome record,
* defines mismatch measures that say:

  * how far the unitary description is from a single outcome story,
  * how far the outcome probabilities are from Born rule expectations,
* combines these into a single measurement tension functional.

With that in place, Q026 describes two kinds of worlds.

* In a low tension world, there is an encoding of measurement where this tension remains small and stable across all realistic experiments.
* In a high tension world, no matter how you encode measurement within a fair class of models, some experiments or thought experiments always push the tension above a positive threshold.

This does not prove or disprove any interpretation of quantum mechanics. It turns the measurement problem into a structured question:

* What encodings keep the tension small?
* What experiments would push it high?
* How do different proposed solutions fare under the same scoring rule?

All of these statements are made strictly at the effective layer and do not choose any specific interpretation of quantum mechanics or any particular collapse model.

## Tension Universe effective-layer footer

This page is part of the **WFGY / Tension Universe** S problem collection at the effective layer.

### Scope of claims

* The goal of this document is to specify an **effective layer encoding** of the Q026 quantum measurement problem in terms of tension functionals, mismatch observables, and falsification oriented experiments.
* It does not claim to prove or disprove the canonical measurement problem in any physical or philosophical sense.
* It does not introduce any new theorem beyond what is already established in the cited literature and standard quantum theory.
* It should not be cited as evidence that the measurement problem has been solved, that any specific interpretation is correct, or that any particular collapse model is confirmed by experiment.

### Effective-layer boundary

* All objects used here (state space `M_meas`, observables, invariants, tension scores, counterfactual worlds) live strictly at the effective layer of the TU framework.
* No TU axiom system, deep generative rule, or constructive mapping from raw experimental data to internal fields is specified.
* Any implementation that uses this page must supply its own mapping from experiments and thought experiments to elements of `M_reg_meas` and must respect the encoding contracts defined here.

### Encoding and fairness

* This page works with an admissible encoding class:

  ```txt
  A_enc_QM_MEAS
  ```

  and encoding elements identified by:

  ```txt
  Encoding_class: A_enc_QM_MEAS
  EncodingKey_Q026: A_enc_QM_MEAS_v1_2026_01_29
  LibraryKey_ref_Q026: LIB_QM_MEAS_EXP_v1
  WeightKey_Q026: W_QM_MEAS_default_v1
  ```

* For any analysis run, the encoding element `E_QM_MEAS` indicated by these keys must be fixed **before** scoring scenarios, and all weights, thresholds, tolerances, and reference distributions belonging to that element must be held fixed across all scenarios in that run.

* Changing any of these parameters defines a new encoding element and must be accompanied by a change in at least one of the keys above. It is not permitted to retune the encoding element after seeing individual experiment outcomes in order to drive `Tension_QM_MEAS` down.

### Cross-problem reuse boundary

* Components exported by Q026 (for example `MeasurementConsistencyTension_Functional`, `MeasurementExperimentPattern_Library`, `OutcomeRecordAbstraction_Descriptor`) may be reused as **patterns** in other problems such as Q027, Q034, and Q123.

* Each target problem must define its own encoding class, keys, weights, and thresholds. Other problems may not reuse `EncodingKey_Q026`, `LibraryKey_ref_Q026`, or `WeightKey_Q026` as if they were universal.

* Cross-problem reuse does not imply that a solution for Q026 would solve any other problem, or that tension scores can be directly compared across problems without an explicit normalization procedure.

### Relation to TU charters

This page should be read together with the following charters:

* [TU Effective Layer Charter](../Charters/TU_EFFECTIVE_LAYER_CHARTER.md)
* [TU Encoding and Fairness Charter](../Charters/TU_ENCODING_AND_FAIRNESS_CHARTER.md)
* [TU Tension Scale Charter](../Charters/TU_TENSION_SCALE_CHARTER.md)
* [TU Global Guardrails](../Charters/TU_GLOBAL_GUARDRAILS.md)

## 0. Effective layer disclaimer

All content in this entry is written at the effective layer of the Tension Universe (TU) framework. It should be read with the following constraints in mind.

* This page specifies an effective layer encoding contract for Q110 (Evolution of institutions). It describes state spaces, observables, invariants, tension scores, singular sets, and experiment patterns.
* It does not claim to solve the canonical institutional evolution problem. It does not claim any general closed form law of history or any universal phase diagram of institutions.
* It does not introduce any new theorem beyond what is already established in the cited literature. All theoretical statements are interpretations and encoding choices at the effective layer.
* It does not provide any explicit mapping from raw historical records, micro level agent models, or archival material into TU internal fields. It only assumes that for suitable data pipelines there exist coherent summaries that can instantiate the observables defined below.
* All constructions use a hybrid semantics. Time, units, and institutional entities are treated as discrete indices. Indicators, stress summaries, and tension scores are treated as real valued quantities.
* All encodings for Q110 belong to an admissible encoding class denoted E_INST, defined in Section 3.4. Each element e_INST in E_INST fixes the functional forms, parameter grids, and weight choices used to compute Q110 observables.
* For any given experiment or study, a single encoding e_INST must be chosen from E_INST before inspecting the outcomes of that experiment. That encoding is then applied to all states in that experiment. Any change in functional forms, parameter grids, or weights constitutes a new encoding e_INST' and must be treated as a separate experiment.
* Falsification of a particular encoding e_INST at the effective layer counts as evidence about that encoding only. It does not prove or disprove any grand theory of institutional evolution outside the TU framework.

Readers should consult the TU charters listed in the footer for the general rules that govern effective layer encodings, fairness constraints, and tension scales.

## 1. Canonical problem and status

### 1.1 Canonical statement

Institutions are the formal and informal rules that structure repeated interaction in societies. They include constitutions, laws, regulations, enforcement bodies, and shared norms of behavior. They shape which coalitions can form, which contracts can be enforced, and which long run trajectories remain feasible.

The canonical problem for Q110 is:

> Is there a general, testable description of how institutions emerge, adapt, ossify, and collapse under long run social, economic, and environmental pressures, beyond specific historical narratives or case studies?

More concretely, Q110 asks for:

1. Effective layer state variables that describe institutional configurations and their stress environment.
2. Tension functionals that measure misalignment between rules, incentives, legitimacy, and adaptation.
3. Conditions under which institutions remain inside an adaptive corridor versus drifting toward brittle or predatory regimes.
4. Experiment patterns, both historical and synthetic, that can falsify particular encodings of these laws.

This is not a request for a single closed form equation for history. It is a request for a constrained and falsifiable description of institutional evolution as a socio technical tension system.

### 1.2 Status and difficulty

The evolution of institutions has been studied from several angles.

* Economic history and institutional economics highlight how institutions co evolve with technology and factor endowments, and how small initial differences can lead to large long run divergence.
* Political economy emphasizes elite incentives, coalition formation, and the logic of inclusive versus extractive institutions.
* Complexity and systems theory treat institutions as parts of adaptive networks with feedback, path dependence, and lock in.
* Sociology and anthropology focus on norms, legitimacy, and informal governance that often matter as much as written rules.

Despite many influential frameworks, there is no widely accepted general law for institutional evolution with both predictive power and clear falsifiability. Many proposed theories are qualitative or strongly dependent on specific historical episodes. Others introduce broad mechanisms that are difficult to test cleanly.

The difficulty of Q110 lies in several features.

* High dimensional state spaces and many latent variables.
* Feedback between institutions and the agents they govern.
* Rare but extreme events such as revolutions, wars, and systemic crises.
* Data limitations and selection bias in historical records.

### 1.3 Role in the BlackHole project

Within the BlackHole S problem collection, Q110 has three main roles.

1. It is the primary node for institutional evolution as a socio_technical_field with incentive_tension and risk_tail_tension as central tension types.
2. It provides shared institutional state variables and tension scores that can be reused by problems on crashes, climate, pandemics, migration, and AI oversight.
3. It serves as an example of how to encode soft, narrative heavy domains inside the Tension Universe while preserving falsifiability and clear domain restrictions.

## 2. Position in the BlackHole graph

This block records how Q110 connects to other problems in the BlackHole graph. Edges are given with one line reasons that point to concrete components or tension types.

### 2.1 Upstream problems

These problems supply prerequisites and tools for Q110.

* Q104 (BH_ECON_INEQUALITY_DYN_L3_104)
  Reason: Inequality dynamics define long run stresses and coalitions that constrain which institutional reforms are politically feasible.

* Q105 (BH_COMPLEX_CRASHES_L3_105)
  Reason: Crash dynamics reveal how institutional structures behave near systemic failure and which tensions become dominant.

* Q106 (BH_COMPLEX_NETWORK_ROBUST_L3_106)
  Reason: Institutional structures are embedded in multilayer networks; network robustness primitives are reused when describing institutional resilience.

* Q107 (BH_SOC_COLLECTIVE_ACTION_L3_107)
  Reason: Collective action constraints determine when rules can be enforced or changed, feeding directly into institutional adaptation capacity.

* Q108 (BH_SOC_POLARIZATION_L3_108)
  Reason: Polarization levels act as stress inputs for Q110 and shape legitimacy and compliance fields.

### 2.2 Downstream problems

These problems reuse Q110 components or depend on its institutional state variables.

* Q101 (BH_ECON_EQUITY_PREM_L3_101)
  Reason: Long run equity premia depend on institutional quality and collapse risk tension imported from Q110.

* Q103 (BH_ECON_GROWTH_SLOW_L3_103)
  Reason: Growth slowdown regimes are partially explained by institutional evolution phases and adaptation rates provided by Q110.

* Q109 (BH_SOC_MIGRATION_L3_109)
  Reason: Migration flows respond to institutional regimes and their evolution; Q110 supplies institutional phase variables.

* Q120 (BH_PHIL_VALUE_OF_INFORMATION_L3_120)
  Reason: The value and misuse of information depend on institutional channels and oversight structures encoded through Q110.

### 2.3 Parallel problems

Parallel nodes share similar tension types but have no direct component dependence.

* Q105 (BH_COMPLEX_CRASHES_L3_105)
  Reason: Both address risk_tail_tension in large socio technical systems. Q105 focuses on event level crashes and Q110 focuses on slow moving institutional structures.

* Q108 (BH_SOC_POLARIZATION_L3_108)
  Reason: Both feature incentive_tension under feedback between agents and higher order structures, but Q108 focuses on opinion distributions.

* Q098 (BH_EARTH_ANTHROPOCENE_L3_098)
  Reason: Both describe long horizon socio ecological dynamics where institutions and environmental stresses co evolve.

### 2.4 Cross domain edges

Cross domain edges indicate problems that can reuse Q110 components in other fields.

* Q091 (BH_EARTH_CLIMATE_SENS_L3_091)
  Reason: Policy response envelopes to climate sensitivity scenarios depend on institutional adaptation phases drawn from Q110.

* Q092 (BH_EARTH_TIPPING_L3_092)
  Reason: Social tipping points interact with institutional thresholds and collapse risk tension defined in Q110.

* Q100 (BH_EARTH_PANDEMIC_RISK_L3_100)
  Reason: Pandemic preparedness and response are governed by institutional structures whose evolution follows Q110 primitives.

* Q124 (BH_AI_OVERSIGHT_L3_124)
  Reason: AI oversight bodies are institutions embedded in socio technical systems; Q110 provides general rules for their evolution and failure modes.

## 3. Tension Universe encoding (effective layer)

All content in this block is at the effective layer. We only describe state spaces, observables, invariants, tension scores, encoding classes, and singular sets. We do not describe any hidden generative rules or any mapping from raw historical data or simulations to TU internal fields.

### 3.1 State space

We assume a semantic state space

```txt
M
```

where each element `m` represents a coherent institutional configuration for a given society or organization over a specified time window.

At the effective layer, each `m` encodes the following summaries.

* A summary of formal rules and organizational structures, such as constitutions, legal frameworks, regulatory bodies, and decision procedures.
* A summary of enforcement and administrative capacity, including the ability to apply rules in practice and to resolve disputes.
* A summary of informal norms and legitimacy signals across major groups, including perceived fairness and acceptance.
* A summary of external and internal stressors during the time window, such as economic shocks, conflict intensity, ecological pressures, and demographic strain.

We do not specify how M is constructed from raw records. We only assume that, for a given encoding in E_INST, these summaries are coherent enough for the observables below to be well defined and finite on a regular domain.

### 3.2 Observables and fields

We introduce effective observables on M.

1. Structural complexity and modularity

   ```txt
   I_structure(m) >= 0
   ```

   * Measures how differentiated and modular the rule set and organizational chart are in configuration `m`.
   * High values correspond to many specialized roles and checks. Low values correspond to very simple or highly concentrated rule sets.

2. Enforcement effectiveness

   ```txt
   I_enforcement(m) >= 0
   ```

   * Measures effective enforcement capacity and predictability in `m`.
   * High values indicate that rules are applied consistently. Low values indicate weak or arbitrary enforcement.

3. Legitimacy and acceptance

   ```txt
   I_legitimacy(m) >= 0
   ```

   * Summarizes perceived legitimacy of institutions among key groups.
   * High values indicate broad acceptance. Low values indicate contested authority and widespread non compliance.

4. Stress environment

   ```txt
   Stress_vector(m) in R^k
   ```

   * Encodes k distinct stress components for configuration `m`, such as economic contraction, conflict intensity, demographic pressure, and ecological strain.
   * Each component is a nonnegative scalar summary for the time window.

5. Adaptation velocity

   ```txt
   Adaptation_rate(m) >= 0
   ```

   * Measures how quickly and coherently institutions adjust rules, enforcement, or organizational structure in response to stress.
   * Very low values correspond to rigid institutions. Very high values can correspond to chaotic or incoherent change.

All observables are defined so that they are finite on regular states in M under admissible encodings e_INST in E_INST.

### 3.3 Tension ingredients

We define three main mismatch observables.

1. Incentive mismatch tension

   ```txt
   DeltaS_incentive(m) >= 0
   ```

   This measures the gap between:

   * the incentives implied by the formal rule set and enforcement structure, and
   * the actual incentives experienced by agents as encoded in `m`.

   High `DeltaS_incentive(m)` indicates that agents can systematically benefit from violating or bypassing formal rules, or from exploiting inconsistencies between written rules and enforcement practice.

2. Stress adaptation tension

   ```txt
   DeltaS_adaptation(m) >= 0
   ```

   This measures the mismatch between:

   * the level and composition of `Stress_vector(m)`, and
   * the observed `Adaptation_rate(m)` and direction of change in `I_structure`, `I_enforcement`, and `I_legitimacy`.

   High `DeltaS_adaptation(m)` indicates that institutions change too slowly or in misaligned ways relative to stress.

3. Collapse risk tension

   ```txt
   DeltaS_risk_tail(m) >= 0
   ```

   This is an effective measure of tail risk that the institutional configuration will experience a major breakdown or regime change in the near future. It aggregates signals such as:

   * very high incentive mismatch,
   * rapid declines in legitimacy,
   * growing stress with low adaptation.

   It is defined at the effective layer as a scalar risk tension, not as a precise probabilistic forecast.

### 3.4 Encoding class E_INST

To prevent arbitrary tuning and to align with TU encoding and fairness charters, we restrict attention to an admissible encoding class for Q110, denoted

```txt
E_INST
```

An element of E_INST, written `e_INST`, consists of the following choices.

* A finite template library for effective observables:

  * templates for `I_structure`, `I_enforcement`, `I_legitimacy`, `Stress_vector`, and `Adaptation_rate` built from standard indices or simulation summaries,
  * templates for `DeltaS_incentive`, `DeltaS_adaptation`, and `DeltaS_risk_tail` as functions of these observables.

* For each template, a finite parameter grid from which concrete parameter values are selected. Parameters include, for example, weights on subcomponents of `Stress_vector`, time smoothing windows, and thresholds inside risk indicators.

* A finite admissible set for the weight triplet:

  ```txt
  (w_inc, w_adapt, w_risk)
  ```

  where each component is positive, the sum equals 1, and all admissible triplets lie on a fixed finite rational grid.

* Fixed functional forms for:

  ```txt
  DeltaS_inst(m)
  I_resilience(m)
  I_corridor(m)
  ```

  chosen from finite libraries and parameterized by the grids above.

Within any encoding e_INST in E_INST, all template choices, parameter values, and weight triplets are fixed before evaluating any particular world state `m` for a given experiment. Once an encoding e_INST is fixed for that experiment:

* all states in that experiment are evaluated under the same e_INST;
* any change in templates, parameter grids, or weights defines a new encoding `e_INST'` that must be labeled and treated as a separate encoding;
* results obtained under different encodings cannot be merged without explicit tracking of the encoding identity.

Experiments in Section 6 are understood to be carried out under encodings e_INST from E_INST that are chosen in advance, recorded with a stable identifier (for example `e_INST_v1`), and not adapted per state or per outcome.

### 3.5 Combined institutional tension

We define a combined institutional tension observable:

```txt
DeltaS_inst(m) = w_inc * DeltaS_incentive(m)
               + w_adapt * DeltaS_adaptation(m)
               + w_risk * DeltaS_risk_tail(m)
```

where:

* `w_inc`, `w_adapt`, and `w_risk` are positive weights that satisfy:

  ```txt
  w_inc + w_adapt + w_risk = 1
  ```

* The triplet `(w_inc, w_adapt, w_risk)` is selected from the finite admissible set belonging to the chosen encoding `e_INST` in `E_INST`.

* The weights are selected and recorded before evaluating any outcome in a given experiment and do not depend on the specific world state `m` or on the experiment results.

This combined observable is well defined and finite on the regular domain M_reg defined below.

### 3.6 Effective tension tensor

Following the general TU core, we assume an effective semantic tension tensor on M:

```txt
T_ij(m) = S_i(m) * C_j(m) * DeltaS_inst(m) * lambda(m) * kappa
```

where:

* `S_i(m)` is a source factor representing the strength of the ith institutional or agent group source component in configuration `m`.
* `C_j(m)` is a receptivity factor representing how sensitive the jth downstream domain is to institutional tension, such as financial markets, social stability, or ecological response.
* `DeltaS_inst(m)` is the combined institutional tension defined above.
* `lambda(m)` is a convergence state variable from the TU core that encodes whether local reasoning and adaptation are convergent, recursive, divergent, or chaotic.
* `kappa` is a global coupling constant for Q110 that sets the overall scale of institutional tension in the chosen encoding.

The detailed indexing of `i` and `j` is not needed at the effective layer, as long as for each `m` and fixed encoding `e_INST` the tensor entries are well defined and finite on regular states.

### 3.7 Invariants and effective constraints

We sketch two invariants that will be used in later blocks. Their concrete functional forms are chosen from finite template libraries within E_INST.

1. Resilience band

   ```txt
   I_resilience(m) = f(DeltaS_inst(m), Stress_vector(m))
   ```

   where `f` is a nonnegative function from a finite template library that maps institutional tension and stress levels into a scalar resilience indicator. Low `I_resilience(m)` corresponds to configurations that are far from collapse even under stress. High `I_resilience(m)` indicates proximity to institutional failure.

2. Adaptation corridor indicator

   We define an indicator

   ```txt
   I_corridor(m) in {0, 1}
   ```

   that equals 1 when:

   * `DeltaS_incentive(m)` and `DeltaS_adaptation(m)` are below fixed thresholds that depend on the magnitude of `Stress_vector(m)`, and
   * `I_legitimacy(m)` is above a minimum threshold.

   Otherwise `I_corridor(m)` equals 0. The thresholds are parameters selected from finite grids within the chosen encoding `e_INST`.

   The value `I_corridor(m) = 1` is interpreted as the configuration being inside an adaptive corridor.

### 3.8 Singular set and domain restrictions

Some observables may be undefined or not finite when the encoded summaries are inconsistent or missing. To handle this we define the singular set:

```txt
S_sing = { m in M : any of
           DeltaS_incentive(m),
           DeltaS_adaptation(m),
           DeltaS_risk_tail(m),
           DeltaS_inst(m)
           is undefined or not finite }
```

We impose the following domain restriction.

* All Q110 analysis at the effective layer is carried out on:

  ```txt
  M_reg = M \ S_sing
  ```

* If a protocol would require evaluating these observables on a state in S_sing, the outcome is labeled "out of domain" and is not treated as evidence for or against any institutional evolution law or any particular encoding e_INST.

---

## 4. Tension principle for this problem

This block states how Q110 is characterized as a tension problem within TU, at the effective layer.

### 4.1 Core institutional tension functional

We define the institutional tension functional as:

```txt
Tension_inst(m) = DeltaS_inst(m)
```

so that the combined mismatch in incentives, adaptation, and collapse risk is itself the core tension observable.

By construction:

```txt
Tension_inst(m) >= 0
```

for all `m` in `M_reg` and for any admissible encoding `e_INST` in `E_INST`. Configurations with small `Tension_inst(m)` are interpreted as being internally coherent and suitably adaptive relative to their stress environment. Configurations with large `Tension_inst(m)` are interpreted as being misaligned and at increased risk of failure.

### 4.2 Low tension evolution corridor

At the effective layer, a low tension evolution corridor is specified by the following qualitative properties.

* Incentive mismatches remain bounded despite changing stress. Rule systems adapt in ways that keep `DeltaS_incentive(m)` small.
* Adaptation rates respond to stress in a roughly proportional way. `DeltaS_adaptation(m)` does not accumulate across several stress cycles.
* Collapse risk tension `DeltaS_risk_tail(m)` remains within an acceptable band for long spans of time.
* The resilience indicator `I_resilience(m)` stays below a fixed critical band and the corridor indicator satisfies `I_corridor(m) = 1` for most time steps.

In this corridor, institutional evolution consists mostly of continuous adjustment and modular reform instead of frequent breakdowns.

### 4.3 High tension pre collapse regimes

High tension regimes have the opposite signature.

* Formal rules and actual incentives diverge, leading to sustained high `DeltaS_incentive(m)`.
* Institutions either fail to adapt or change in incoherent bursts that do not track stress, which increases `DeltaS_adaptation(m)`.
* Collapse risk tension `DeltaS_risk_tail(m)` rises, and the resilience indicator moves into a critical band.
* The corridor indicator `I_corridor(m)` frequently takes value 0, especially just before major institutional breakdowns.

Q110 is the request to encode these regimes in terms of well defined observables and to propose conditions under which institutions transition between them in ways that can be tested empirically or in synthetic models under admissible encodings `e_INST` in `E_INST`.

---

## 5. Counterfactual tension worlds

We describe two counterfactual worlds at the effective layer.

* World T: institutions mostly evolve inside a low tension adaptive corridor.
* World F: institutions frequently enter and remain in high tension pre collapse regimes.

No hidden generative rules are specified. These worlds are described only through observable patterns under the effective layer encoding.

### 5.1 World T: adaptive institutions

In World T, for states `m_T` in `M_reg` and a fixed encoding `e_INST` in `E_INST`:

1. Incentive alignment

   * The incentive mismatch tension `DeltaS_incentive(m_T)` remains below a threshold band that scales with stress magnitude.
   * Deviations appear but are corrected by reforms before they become persistent.

2. Adaptation and stress

   * `DeltaS_adaptation(m_T)` remains moderate because adaptation rate adjusts to stress levels.
   * When `Stress_vector(m_T)` increases, institutions gradually revise rules and enforcement structures in ways that decrease adaptation tension after a finite delay.

3. Collapse risk

   * `DeltaS_risk_tail(m_T)` remains low for most configurations, with occasional spikes that are usually resolved by reforms rather than full institutional breakdown.
   * These spikes are preceded by visible increases in `DeltaS_incentive(m_T)` and `DeltaS_adaptation(m_T)`.

4. Corridor occupancy

   * The indicator `I_corridor(m_T)` equals 1 for long stretches of historical time, with relatively rare and short deviations to 0.

### 5.2 World F: brittle or predatory institutions

In World F, for states `m_F` in `M_reg` and a fixed encoding `e_INST`:

1. Incentive drift

   * There are long periods where `DeltaS_incentive(m_F)` increases and stays high, indicating that formal rules and actual incentives are sharply misaligned.
   * Loopholes, corruption, and shadow norms become entrenched.

2. Failed adaptation

   * `Stress_vector(m_F)` grows or fluctuates, but `Adaptation_rate(m_F)` remains low or misdirected.
   * `DeltaS_adaptation(m_F)` remains large, reflecting poor matching between stress and institutional change.

3. Elevated collapse risk

   * `DeltaS_risk_tail(m_F)` stays in or near a critical band.
   * Institutional breakdowns, abrupt regime changes, or severe loss of legitimacy occur more frequently.

4. Corridor occupancy

   * The indicator `I_corridor(m_F)` frequently equals 0 over long spans. Transitions back to 1 are irregular and often followed by new drift into high tension regimes.

### 5.3 Interpretive note

These counterfactual worlds do not assert any specific micro level mechanism. They only state that, given an effective institutional encoding and a fixed encoding `e_INST` in `E_INST`, observable tension patterns would look very different in a world where institutions reliably adapt and in a world where they routinely become brittle or predatory.

---

## 6. Falsifiability and discriminating experiments

This block describes experiments and protocols that can falsify specific Q110 encodings at the effective layer. They do not prove or disprove any particular grand theory of institutions, but they can reject particular choices of observables and tension functionals within E_INST.

Unless stated otherwise, all experiments below are understood to be carried out under a fixed encoding `e_INST` in `E_INST` chosen and recorded before any outcomes are inspected.

### Experiment 1: Historical panel tension tracking

**Goal**

Test whether a given encoding `e_INST` can produce institutional tension scores that meaningfully anticipate major institutional breakdowns or sustained stability in a historical panel.

**Setup**

* Select a panel of countries or large organizations over several decades with recorded institutional and macro indicators.
* For each time window, construct an effective state `m_data` that encodes `I_structure`, `I_enforcement`, `I_legitimacy`, `Stress_vector`, and `Adaptation_rate` using published indices and event data.
* Fix:

  * an encoding `e_INST` in `E_INST`,
  * a weight triplet `(w_inc, w_adapt, w_risk)` from its finite admissible set,
  * threshold bands for `I_resilience` and `I_corridor` from the finite grids associated with `e_INST`,

  before looking at breakdown outcomes.

**Protocol**

1. For each configuration `m_data` in the panel, compute under `e_INST`:

   * `DeltaS_incentive(m_data)`,
   * `DeltaS_adaptation(m_data)`,
   * `DeltaS_risk_tail(m_data)`,
   * `Tension_inst(m_data)`,
   * `I_resilience(m_data)`,
   * `I_corridor(m_data)`.

2. Label periods as "pre breakdown" if a major institutional collapse or regime change occurs within a fixed forward window and "non breakdown" otherwise.

3. Compare the distribution of `Tension_inst(m_data)` and `I_corridor(m_data)` values between pre breakdown and non breakdown periods.

4. Repeat with different panels and time horizons to test robustness. Each run that changes the encoding uses a new labeled encoding identifier, such as `e_INST_v2`.

**Metrics**

* Separation between tension distributions for pre breakdown and non breakdown periods.
* Hit rate and false alarm rate when using threshold rules on `Tension_inst` or `I_corridor` as early warning indicators.
* Stability of results under variation of weights and thresholds that remains inside the predefined finite admissible sets of `e_INST`.

**Falsification conditions**

* If, across multiple panels and reasonable encodings `e_INST`, `Tension_inst` fails to distinguish pre breakdown from non breakdown periods better than simple baselines such as random or trivial predictors, the current encoding `e_INST` is considered falsified at the effective layer.
* If small and justified parameter changes inside the admissible grids of `e_INST` cannot salvage predictive separation, the encoding `e_INST` is rejected as ineffective for institutional evolution.

**Semantics implementation note**

The experiment treats the hybrid semantics as a combination of discrete time steps and continuous indicator values. All observables are computed from finite historical records and are represented as real valued summaries indexed by discrete periods.

**Boundary note**

Falsifying an encoding `e_INST` in `E_INST` does not solve the canonical institutional evolution problem. This experiment only rejects specific institutional tension encodings and does not deliver a complete law of institutional evolution.

---

### Experiment 2: Synthetic agent based institutional models

**Goal**

Check whether Q110 tension metrics under encodings `e_INST` can reliably distinguish robust and fragile institutions in controlled synthetic societies where ground truth robustness is known by construction.

**Setup**

* Construct simple agent based models with different institutional designs, such as:

  * high concentration of authority versus distributed authority,
  * clear enforcement rules versus ambiguous enforcement,
  * inclusive decision rules versus narrow elite control.

* Subject these models to controlled stress processes, such as shocks to resources, external threats, or internal conflicts.

* Fix an encoding `e_INST` in `E_INST`, including the templates and parameter grids used to compute Q110 observables.

**Protocol**

1. For each model configuration and time window, map the simulated institutional state into an effective state `m_sim` in `M_reg` with values for `I_structure`, `I_enforcement`, `I_legitimacy`, `Stress_vector`, and `Adaptation_rate` under `e_INST`.

2. Compute:

   * `DeltaS_incentive(m_sim)`,
   * `DeltaS_adaptation(m_sim)`,
   * `DeltaS_risk_tail(m_sim)`,
   * `Tension_inst(m_sim)`,
   * `I_corridor(m_sim)`,

   along each simulated trajectory.

3. Label model runs as "robust" if institutions maintain function under stress and "fragile" if they suffer collapse or severe loss of function.

4. Compare tension patterns across robust and fragile designs and across different encodings `e_INST` in `E_INST`.

**Metrics**

* Mean and variance of `Tension_inst(m_sim)` for robust and fragile runs.
* Frequency with which `I_corridor(m_sim)` remains equal to 1 in robust designs and drops to 0 in fragile designs.
* Time lead between tension spikes and observed collapse events in fragile models.

**Falsification conditions**

* If Q110 tension metrics under encodings `e_INST` fail to separate clearly robust and clearly fragile institutional designs in a wide range of synthetic models, those encodings are considered misaligned with institutional stability and are rejected.
* If designs that are obviously fragile by construction consistently produce lower `Tension_inst` than robust designs, the current choice of observables or weights inside the tested `e_INST` encodings is considered invalid at the effective layer.

**Semantics implementation note**

The simulation state space is discrete in time and agent configuration, but observables are aggregated into continuous summary values at each time step, consistent with the hybrid semantics in the metadata and with the encoding `e_INST`.

**Boundary note**

Falsifying encodings `e_INST` in `E_INST` does not solve the canonical institutional evolution problem. Success or failure on synthetic models only tests the usefulness and validity of particular encodings, not any universal law of institutional evolution.

## 7. AI and WFGY engineering spec

This block describes how Q110 structures can be used as modules inside AI systems within the WFGY framework, at the effective layer and under encodings in `E_INST`. All signals and modules defined here are derived from effective layer observables only and do not assume access to TU deep generative rules.

### 7.1 Training signals

We define several training signals for models that reason about institutions.

1. `signal_institutional_alignment`

   * Definition: a penalty proportional to `DeltaS_incentive(m)` whenever the model proposes institutional stories where written rules and implied incentives conflict strongly, with `DeltaS_incentive` computed under a fixed encoding `e_INST`.
   * Purpose: encourage narratives where incentives, rules, and enforcement form a coherent pattern.

2. `signal_adaptive_response`

   * Definition: a signal derived from `DeltaS_adaptation(m)` during sequences that describe shocks and institutional responses.
   * Purpose: reward sequences where adaptation matches the magnitude and direction of stresses, according to the Q110 encoding `e_INST`.

3. `signal_collapse_risk_awareness`

   * Definition: an auxiliary head that predicts `DeltaS_risk_tail(m)` given an institutional context, with loss based on consistency between predicted risk tension and described events.
   * Purpose: teach the model to identify configurations that are near institutional collapse in its internal representation.

4. `signal_corridor_stability`

   * Definition: a signal that compresses multiple observables into a soft version of `I_corridor(m)` and penalizes frequent transitions out of the corridor in scenarios that historically remained stable.
   * Purpose: align the model with empirical patterns of long run stability under a chosen encoding `e_INST`.

In each case, the encoding identifier `e_INST` used to compute the signals is recorded in evaluation logs together with the signals themselves.

### 7.2 Architectural patterns

We outline module patterns that reuse Q110 components at the effective layer.

1. `InstitutionTensionHead`

   * Role: given an internal embedding of an institutional context, output estimates of `DeltaS_incentive`, `DeltaS_adaptation`, `DeltaS_risk_tail`, and `Tension_inst` under a fixed encoding `e_INST`.
   * Interface: input is a context embedding; outputs are four nonnegative scalars.

2. `ShockResponseModule`

   * Role: predict likely institutional adaptations given a stress vector and current configuration.
   * Interface: inputs are an embedding of `m` and a representation of `Stress_vector(m)`; outputs are proposals for changes in structure, enforcement, and legitimacy with associated changes in tension metrics.

3. `ScenarioComparator`

   * Role: compare alternative institutional scenarios for the same stress environment and return which is more likely to remain inside the adaptive corridor.
   * Interface: inputs are pairs of scenario embeddings and stress summaries; outputs are rankings and tension differences, computed under a fixed encoding `e_INST`.

All modules are implemented so that they only depend on effective layer summaries, not on any hidden TU construction.

### 7.3 Evaluation harness

We propose an evaluation harness that uses historical and synthetic vignettes.

1. Task selection

   * Assemble short descriptions of historical episodes where institutions faced major stress events with known outcomes, such as collapse, reform, or continued stability.

2. Conditions

   * Baseline: models answer questions about these episodes without explicit Q110 modules or signals.
   * TU condition: models are augmented with the Q110 modules under a fixed encoding `e_INST`, and tension metrics are used as auxiliary losses and outputs.

3. Metrics

   * Accuracy on questions about which episodes led to institutional breakdown versus reform.
   * Consistency in explaining why some institutions adapted and others failed, measured by internal use of tension variables.
   * Stability of answers under small perturbations of prompts that do not change the underlying institutional facts.

4. Logging

   * For each run, logs record:

     * the encoding identifier `e_INST`,
     * all relevant tension observables,
     * prompts and model outputs,
     * any auxiliary loss values tied to Q110.

### 7.4 60 second reproduction protocol

This protocol lets external users experience the effect of Q110 encoding in an AI system without exposing any TU deep generative rule.

* Baseline setup

  * Prompt: ask the model to explain why some countries have institutions that adapt successfully to shocks while others repeatedly collapse or drift into predatory regimes, using any concepts it prefers.
  * Observation: record whether the explanation is mostly a list of stories or whether it identifies clear structural patterns and measurable tensions.

* TU encoded setup

  * Prompt: ask the same question but require the model to structure its answer using:

    * institutional tension between rules, incentives, and stress,
    * the distinction between staying inside an adaptive corridor and entering high tension regimes,
    * the Q110 observables at the effective layer under a fixed encoding `e_INST`.

  * Observation: record whether the explanation becomes more structured, with explicit reference to incentive mismatch, adaptation gaps, and collapse risk.

* Comparison metric

  * Use a rubric for structure, clarity of mechanisms, and consistency across examples.
  * Optionally, have independent evaluators judge which explanation better captures known results in institutional economics and political economy.

* What to log

  * Prompts, full responses, the encoding identifier `e_INST`, and any auxiliary tension scores from Q110 modules.

This allows later analysis of how the model uses institutional tension in its reasoning process, while staying entirely within the effective layer.

## 8. Cross problem transfer template

This block lists reusable components produced by Q110 and their direct reuse targets. All components are effective layer constructs and are defined relative to a fixed encoding `e_INST` in `E_INST`.

### 8.1 Reusable components produced by this problem

1. ComponentName: `InstitutionalTensionKernel`

   * Type: functional

   * Minimal interface:

     ```txt
     inputs: institution_summary, stress_summary
     output: tension_tuple
             = (DeltaS_incentive,
                DeltaS_adaptation,
                DeltaS_risk_tail,
                Tension_inst)
     ```

   * Preconditions:

     * The summaries encode coherent values for structure, enforcement, legitimacy, and stress over a time window.
     * A fixed encoding `e_INST` in `E_INST` has been selected, which determines the concrete formulas for each component of the tension tuple.

2. ComponentName: `InstitutionEvolutionPhaseDiagram`

   * Type: field

   * Minimal interface:

     ```txt
     inputs: institution_summary, stress_summary
     output: phase_label in {
               adaptive_corridor,
               brittle,
               predatory,
               chaotic
             }
     ```

   * Preconditions:

     * The mapping from observables to phase labels is fixed in advance within a chosen encoding `e_INST`.
     * Phase labels are consistent with Q110 tension definitions and with the thresholds used for `I_corridor`.

3. ComponentName: `ShockResponseTemplate`

   * Type: experiment_pattern

   * Minimal interface:

     ```txt
     inputs: shock_profile, initial_institution_summary
     output: set of plausible institutional response trajectories,
             each with associated tension profiles
     ```

   * Preconditions:

     * The shock profile can be represented as a change in `Stress_vector` over time.
     * The encoding `e_INST` used for tension profiles is fixed for the duration of each experiment.

### 8.2 Direct reuse targets

1. Q105 (BH_COMPLEX_CRASHES_L3_105)

   * Reused component: `InstitutionalTensionKernel`.
   * Why it transfers: crash probability and severity depend on institutional tension in financial and governance systems.
   * What changes: the stress summary includes financial variables and the phase labels in the crash analysis are aligned with crash regimes.

2. Q098 (BH_EARTH_ANTHROPOCENE_L3_098)

   * Reused component: `InstitutionEvolutionPhaseDiagram`.
   * Why it transfers: socio ecological regimes depend on whether institutions remain adaptive under escalating environmental stress.
   * What changes: stress summaries include ecological indicators and resource constraints.

3. Q100 (BH_EARTH_PANDEMIC_RISK_L3_100)

   * Reused component: `ShockResponseTemplate`.
   * Why it transfers: pandemic shocks stress health and governance institutions; response trajectories can be encoded using the same template.
   * What changes: shock profiles focus on epidemiological and health system loads.

4. Q124 (BH_AI_OVERSIGHT_L3_124)

   * Reused components: `InstitutionalTensionKernel` and `InstitutionEvolutionPhaseDiagram`.
   * Why it transfers: AI oversight bodies are institutions with their own rules, incentives, and stress; their evolution can be analyzed using Q110 primitives.
   * What changes: institution summaries include technical oversight capacity and interaction with AI systems.

## 9. TU roadmap and verification levels

### 9.1 Current levels

* E_level: E1

  * A coherent effective encoding of institutional evolution is specified in terms of state space, observables, tension functionals, singular sets, and an admissible encoding class `E_INST`.
  * Experiment patterns are outlined but not yet implemented on shared public data or widely studied simulation suites.

* N_level: N2

  * The narrative connecting rules, incentives, stress, adaptation, and collapse is explicit and consistent across World T and World F.
  * Reusable components and cross domain links are identified at the effective layer.

### 9.2 Next measurable step toward E2

To reach E2 for Q110, at least one of the following should be completed and documented under explicit encodings `e_INST` in `E_INST`.

1. Implement Experiment 1 by constructing an open data set of `Tension_inst` and `I_corridor` values over a historical panel and publish the results, including:

   * the exact encoding identifier `e_INST`,
   * code that computes Q110 observables over a chosen period,
   * published tension profiles for that period,
   * and at least one rejected encoding in `E_INST` whose failures are clearly explained.

2. Implement Experiment 2 by creating a transparent agent based model suite where:

   * at least one weak drift, robust design and one fragile, high tension design are specified by construction,
   * Q110 tension metrics under a fixed encoding `e_INST` demonstrably separate robust and fragile institutional designs,
   * and the role of each observable and weight choice in that separation is documented.

Both steps operate only on observable summaries and respect the effective layer boundary. They do not require exposing any TU deep generative rule.

### 9.3 Long term role in the TU program

In the long run, Q110 is expected to function as:

* The main institutional node supplying state variables and tension metrics to problems concerning crashes, climate, pandemics, migration, and AI oversight.
* A template for encoding soft institutional narratives as tension systems with falsifiable components and clear domain restrictions.
* A bridge between qualitative institutional theory and quantitative complex systems approaches, by forcing both to speak through shared observables and tension functionals defined inside `E_INST`.

## 10. Elementary but precise explanation

At a simple level, Q110 is about the life cycle of rules.

Every society has rules and organizations that say who can do what, who decides, and how conflicts are settled. These rules and organizations are called institutions. They do not stay still. They are pushed and pulled by:

* economic changes,
* wars and conflicts,
* new technologies,
* environmental shocks,
* and struggles among different groups.

Sometimes institutions adjust in time. They reform peacefully, close loopholes, and add new checks. Sometimes they become rigid or corrupt. Tension builds up. People stop believing in them. At some point they may crack or be replaced by new ones.

The Tension Universe view does not try to predict exact historical events. Instead it asks three questions.

1. Can we describe each institutional situation with a small set of numbers that capture:

   * how rules are written,
   * how they are enforced,
   * how legitimate they feel,
   * how strong the pressures are,
   * and how fast the system is changing?

2. Can we combine these into a single "institutional tension" number that is low when rules, incentives, and pressures are in rough balance, and high when they are not?

3. Can we design experiments, using both history and computer models, that test whether this tension number really tells us something about which institutions will survive and which ones are about to fail?

In this setting:

* A low tension world is one where institutions usually adjust before stress becomes dangerous. Incentives, rules, and enforcement fit together reasonably well. Big collapses are rare.
* A high tension world is one where rules and real incentives drift apart, stress keeps rising, adaptation is slow or chaotic, and collapse becomes more likely.

Q110 does not claim to give a final theory of history. It sets up a way to talk about institutional evolution using clear observables and tension scores that live at the effective layer. These can then be tested, reused in other problems, and improved over time without exposing any hidden construction of deep TU fields.

## Tension Universe effective layer footer

This page is part of the WFGY / Tension Universe S problem collection.

### Scope of claims

* The goal of this document is to specify an effective layer encoding of the institutional evolution problem labeled Q110.
* It does not claim to prove or disprove the canonical statement described in Section 1.
* It does not introduce any new theorem beyond what is already established in the cited literature.
* It should not be cited as evidence that the corresponding open problem in institutional economics, political science, or complex systems theory has been solved.

### Effective layer boundary

* All objects used here, such as the state space `M`, observables, invariants, tension scores, and counterfactual worlds, live at the effective layer of the Tension Universe framework.
* No explicit mapping is given from raw historical data or micro level agent dynamics to these objects. Any such mapping is part of separate data or modeling pipelines.
* When this document refers to "worlds" or "regimes" it refers to patterns in effective layer observables, not to any hidden TU deep generative rule.

### Encoding class and non adaptive use

* All encodings for Q110 belong to the admissible encoding class `E_INST` defined in Section 3.4.
* For any experiment or application, a single encoding `e_INST` must be chosen from `E_INST` before inspecting outcomes and must be used for all states in that experiment.
* Changing templates, parameter grids, or weights defines a new encoding `e_INST'` and must be treated as a separate encoding with its own identifier and results.
* Encodings must not be tuned adaptively on a state by state basis in order to minimize or maximize tension scores after outcomes are known.

### Open problem status

* Q110 remains an open structural problem. This document provides an effective layer contract for how to talk about institutional evolution inside the Tension Universe framework.
* Implementations of the experiments described here can falsify particular encodings `e_INST` in `E_INST`. They cannot by themselves settle the canonical institutional evolution problem.

### Reuse and transfer

* Components such as `InstitutionalTensionKernel`, `InstitutionEvolutionPhaseDiagram`, and `ShockResponseTemplate` are designed for reuse in other S problems that involve institutional dynamics.
* Any reuse should respect the effective layer boundary and the encoding class rules stated above.

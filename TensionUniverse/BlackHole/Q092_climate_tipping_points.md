## 0. Effective layer disclaimer

All statements in this entry are made strictly at the effective layer of the Tension Universe (TU) framework.

* The goal of this document is to specify an effective layer encoding of the canonical climate tipping point problem for use inside the WFGY and TU programs.
* It does not prove or disprove any canonical climate tipping claim and it does not introduce any new theorem, inequality, or numerical bound beyond what is already established in the cited literature.
* It does not state that climate tipping points have been solved or that any particular value of a physical threshold has been determined.
* All objects that appear here state spaces `M`, finite tipping element libraries, observables, invariants, tension scores, and counterfactual worlds are defined only at the effective layer.
* No deep layer TU axiom system, generating rule, or construction of TU fields from raw data is specified in this page.
* Any mapping from raw climate data or from climate model output into the effective layer objects described here is treated as implementation detail and is outside the scope of this document.
* The experiments in Section 6 can falsify or support particular instances of the encoding identified by the `Encoding_key`. They do not by themselves resolve the canonical scientific question.

This page should therefore be read as a precise bookkeeping scheme for climate tipping tension inside TU and WFGY, not as a claim that the underlying scientific problem has been settled.

## 1. Canonical problem and status

### 1.1 Canonical statement

A climate tipping point is a critical threshold in a subsystem of the Earth system such that:

* Once the subsystem crosses that threshold, its state is pushed toward a qualitatively different regime.
* The transition can be abrupt on human time scales and it can be difficult or effectively irreversible on those scales.

Typical examples of tipping elements include:

* Major ice sheets such as the Greenland and West Antarctic ice sheets.
* Large scale ocean circulation patterns such as the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation.
* Monsoon systems and large scale rainfall regimes.
* Large biomes such as the Amazon rainforest, boreal forests, and permafrost regions.

The canonical problem for Q092 is:

> To understand, at an effective and coarse grained level, when and how coupled climate subsystems approach and cross their tipping thresholds, and how local threshold crossings can cascade into large scale Earth system regime shifts.

This includes:

* Identifying key subsystems that behave as tipping elements.
* Characterizing their thresholds in terms of state variables and external forcing.
* Describing how couplings among these subsystems can create cascades of transitions.
* Quantifying how far the current and projected climate states are from such tipping and cascading regimes.

### 1.2 Status and difficulty

The basic concept of climate tipping points is supported by theory, simple models, and paleoclimate evidence. However:

* Exact threshold values, timescales, and cascade patterns are highly uncertain.
* Different climate models and forcing scenarios give different pictures of which elements are closest to tipping.
* The structure of interaction between tipping elements and human systems adds further complexity.

Known points from the literature include:

* Several subsystems such as parts of the Greenland and West Antarctic ice sheets appear to have threshold behavior in sea level contribution on multi century to multimillennium time scales under sustained warming.
* Large scale circulation patterns such as the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation show signs of multiple quasi stable regimes with the possibility of partial or full collapse under some forcing trajectories.
* Tropical and boreal ecosystems and permafrost regions can undergo rapid shifts in vegetation, fire regime, or carbon storage when key climatic thresholds are crossed.

Despite these advances there is no single accepted theory that:

* Cleanly classifies all major tipping elements.
* Specifies their thresholds and mutual couplings in a unified framework.
* Quantifies systemic risk in a way that is both physically grounded and communicable to decision makers.

Q092 is therefore a partially resolved and contested frontier problem at the physical and risk assessment levels.

### 1.3 Role in the BlackHole project

Within the BlackHole S problem collection, Q092 serves as:

1. The flagship example of a risk tail tension problem in the Earth system domain with a focus on rare but high impact regime shifts.
2. A bridge node between physical climate dynamics and socio technical systems that depend on climate stability.
3. A template for encoding:

   * finite libraries of tipping elements,
   * proximity to thresholds,
   * couplings that enable cascades,
   * and tail risk metrics for large scale regime shifts.

The purpose of this entry is to give a disciplined effective layer encoding for these structures so that they can be reused and tested across many TU and WFGY contexts.

## 2. Position in the BlackHole graph

This block records where Q092 sits among Q001 to Q125 with edges and one line reasons. All codes referenced here follow the header metadata of each problem.

### 2.1 Upstream problems

These provide prerequisites or shared machinery for Q092.

* Q091 (`BH_EARTH_CLIMATE_SENS_L3_091`)
  Reason: Supplies the background relation between radiative forcing and large scale temperature response that is used as the baseline field for tipping deviations.

* Q093 (`BH_EARTH_CARBON_CYCLE_L3_093`)
  Reason: Provides the long term carbon feedback structure that can push tipping elements toward or away from their thresholds.

* Q094 (`BH_EARTH_OCEAN_MIX_L3_094`)
  Reason: Encodes deep ocean mixing and circulation as slow regulators of approach to tipping in ice sheets and large scale circulation.

### 2.2 Downstream problems

These reuse Q092 components or treat its outputs as preconditions.

* Q098 (`BH_EARTH_ANTHROPOCENE_L3_098`)
  Reason: Reuses the TippingElementLibrary and ClimateTensionFunctional_CTP to describe regime shifts in human Earth system codynamics.

* Q099 (`BH_EARTH_WATER_STRESS_L3_099`)
  Reason: Uses Q092 tipping states and cascades for example ice melt and monsoon shifts as structured drivers in freshwater availability regimes.

* Q100 (`BH_EARTH_PANDEMIC_RISK_L3_100`)
  Reason: Treats climate tipped states as exogenous shocks that alter ecological and disease basins using Q092 tension outputs as inputs.

### 2.3 Parallel problems

Parallel nodes share similar tension type or structure but do not depend directly on Q092 components.

* Q105 (`BH_SOC_SYSTEMIC_CRASH_L3_105`)
  Reason: Both model risk tail tension in networks of coupled components with possible cascades and sudden regime shifts.

* Q106 (`BH_SOC_MULTILAYER_ROBUSTNESS_L3_106`)
  Reason: Both consider robustness and collapse in multilayer networks with Q092 as the climate specific instance and Q106 as a more abstract network case.

### 2.4 Cross domain edges

Cross domain links reuse Q092 structures in other fields.

* Q032 (`BH_PHYS_QTHERMO_L3_032`)
  Reason: Can reuse the notion of tail transitions between regimes under external driving framed as risk tail tension although with microscopic physical observables.

* Q059 (`BH_CS_INFO_THERMODYN_L3_059`)
  Reason: Uses Q092 as an analogy where low probability high impact transitions in computational or information systems are framed with similar tail tension functionals.

## 3. Tension Universe encoding (effective layer)

All content in this block is at the effective layer. We describe only:

* the state space and finite tipping element library,
* effective observables and invariants,
* tension functionals,
* singular sets and domain restrictions,
* the encoding class and its fairness constraints.

We do not describe how any internal TU fields are generated from raw data or climate models.

### 3.1 State space and finite element library

We fix a finite library of climate tipping elements:

```txt
E = {E_1, E_2, ..., E_k}
```

where each `E_i` is a named subsystem such as:

* `E_1` = Greenland ice sheet
* `E_2` = West Antarctic ice sheet
* `E_3` = Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation
* `E_4` = Amazon rainforest
* `E_5` = West African monsoon

and so on up to a fixed finite `k` chosen once for `Encoding_key: TU_BH_Q092_TIP_v1`.

We define a state space `M` whose elements `m` represent coarse grained climate regimes. For each `m` in `M` the following effective information is encoded.

For each tipping element `E_i`:

* A real valued state variable `X_i(m)` representing a normalized anomaly or load for example ice volume loss fraction circulation strength index biomass fraction.
* A real valued index `theta_i(m)` representing proximity to a tipping threshold.

For the library as a whole:

* A finite directed coupling graph among tipping elements:

  * For each ordered pair `(i, j)` there is a coupling coefficient `C_ij(m)` that encodes effective influence of `E_i` on `E_j` under a fixed representation of interactions.
  * The adjacency and sign structure of `C_ij(m)` is fixed by the chosen encoding class and the `Encoding_key`. Only magnitudes are allowed to vary within bounded ranges specified in Section 3.3.

For external forcing:

* A vector `F(m)` encoding global and regional forcing summaries such as time averaged radiative forcing over a fixed horizon or CO2 concentration profiles.

We do not specify how these effective quantities are computed from general circulation models simplified models or observations. We only assume that for each scenario under consideration there exist states `m` in `M` that encode consistent summaries of these objects.

### 3.2 Observables and fields

We define effective observables as follows.

1. Element state observable

```txt
X_i(m) in R
```

A normalized scalar that indicates the current state of element `E_i` in a dimensionless form as specified by the encoding.

2. Threshold proximity observable

For each element `E_i` we fix a pair of real numbers `L_i` and `U_i` with `L_i < U_i`. These define an element specific threshold band for the encoding class. We then define

```txt
theta_i(m) = (X_i(m) - L_i) / (U_i - L_i)
```

with the interpretation:

* `theta_i(m) <= 0` means the element is safely below the threshold band.
* `0 < theta_i(m) < 1` means it is inside a transition band.
* `theta_i(m) >= 1` means it is beyond the tipping band for element `E_i`.

The pairs `[L_i, U_i]` are part of the encoding specification for `Encoding_key: TU_BH_Q092_TIP_v1` and do not change between scenarios.

3. Coupling field

```txt
C_ij(m) in R
```

A scalar that represents the net effect of state changes in `E_i` on the hazard for `E_j`. For the encoding class chosen here:

* The adjacency pattern and signs of `C_ij(m)` are fixed across all states in `M` for a given `Encoding_key`.
* Only magnitudes are allowed to vary with scenario class and must remain in bounded ranges specified in Section 3.3.

For tension construction we define a normalized coupling matrix:

```txt
C_ij_norm(m) = Norm_C(C_ij(m))
```

where `Norm_C` is a fixed normalization functional chosen from a finite catalog and bound to the `Encoding_key`. All cascade related quantities must be computed with `C_ij_norm` not with arbitrary rescalings.

4. Tail hazard observable

We fix a finite set of time horizons

```txt
Tau = {tau_1, tau_2, ..., tau_L}
```

each `tau_l` a positive time scale such as decades or centuries within a predefined upper limit. For each `m` in `M` and horizon `tau_l` we define a nonnegative tail hazard observable

```txt
rho_tail(m; tau_l) >= 0
```

which is interpreted as an effective measure of the probability rate or intensity of crossing one or more tipping thresholds in the library `E` within time `tau_l` under the forcing profile encoded by `F(m)`.

We do not define the detailed probabilistic construction. We only require that:

* For each `tau_l` and admissible `m` the value `rho_tail(m; tau_l)` is finite and well defined.
* The dependence on `m` is regular enough to allow numerical evaluation in implementations.

5. Combined tipping mismatch observable

We define a nonnegative scalar mismatch

```txt
DeltaS_tip(m) = G(theta_1(m), ..., theta_k(m),
                  C_ij_norm(m) for all i, j,
                  rho_tail(m; tau_l) for tau_l in Tau)
```

where `G` is a fixed function chosen once for the encoding class from a finite catalog of simple functional forms such as max combinations or low degree polynomials. For `Encoding_key: TU_BH_Q092_TIP_v1` the selected `G` is part of the encoding specification.

The function `G` must satisfy:

* `DeltaS_tip(m) >= 0` for all `m` in the regular domain.
* `DeltaS_tip(m)` is small when all elements are far below their threshold bands and tail hazard is small across all horizons in `Tau`.
* `DeltaS_tip(m)` grows when more elements approach or cross their thresholds couplings support cascades and tail hazard increases.

The choice of `G` may not depend on specific scenario outcomes and may not be tuned after looking at particular model results.

### 3.3 Admissible encoding class and fairness constraints

To avoid arbitrary post hoc tuning we define an admissible encoding class `A_enc(Q092)` whose members are specified by the following finite data.

* A finite tipping element library `E` and element specific threshold bands `[L_i, U_i]`.

* A finite catalog `G_catalog` of functional forms for `G`. A single `G` is chosen from this catalog.

* A finite set `Tau` of time horizons.

* A finite catalog `NormC_catalog` of coupling normalization rules. A single normalization rule `Norm_C` is chosen from this catalog.

* A finite library `W_tip` of rational weight triples for the tension functional:

  ```txt
  W_tip = { (alpha, beta, gamma) }
  ```

  where each entry has rational components and satisfies `alpha > 0`, `beta > 0`, `gamma > 0`.

* A finite library `T_thresh` of pairs of rational thresholds:

  ```txt
  T_thresh = { (epsilon_tip, delta_tip) }
  ```

  with `0 < epsilon_tip < delta_tip`.

* Bounded rational ranges for the magnitudes of `C_ij(m)` and for any internal weights or scale parameters that appear inside `G`.

An encoding instance in `A_enc(Q092)` is then specified by picking one element from each of these finite libraries together with the fixed element set `E` and its threshold bands. For this entry:

* `Encoding_key: TU_BH_Q092_TIP_v1` labels one specific such choice.

The fairness constraints are:

1. Once an encoding in `A_enc(Q092)` has been selected and published under a given `Encoding_key`, the choices of `E`, `[L_i, U_i]`, `G`, `Tau`, `Norm_C`, `(alpha, beta, gamma)`, `(epsilon_tip, delta_tip)` and all internal ranges become fixed for all scenarios and experiments that claim to use that key.
2. The choice of `G`, bounds `[L_i, U_i]`, adjacency and sign structure of `C_ij`, horizon set `Tau`, weight triple `(alpha, beta, gamma)`, and thresholds `(epsilon_tip, delta_tip)` cannot depend on the outcomes or goals of any particular scenario.
3. Any change to any of these items defines a new encoding instance and must be declared as a new `Encoding_key` for example `TU_BH_Q092_TIP_v2` not as a silent change to `TU_BH_Q092_TIP_v1`.
4. All evaluations and comparisons inside this page are understood to use the encoding identified by `Encoding_key: TU_BH_Q092_TIP_v1` unless explicitly stated otherwise.

These constraints are designed to prevent artificial reduction of tension by changing thresholds or weights after observing results.

### 3.4 Effective tension tensor components

We define an effective semantic tension tensor over `M` consistent with the TU core pattern:

```txt
T_ij(m) = S_i(m) * R_j(m) * DeltaS_tip(m) * lambda(m) * kappa
```

where:

* `S_i(m)` is a source like factor capturing how strongly the configuration activates different climate or decision relevant channels.
* `R_j(m)` is a receptivity like factor describing sensitivity of different downstream subsystems such as ecological economic or social layers to tipping related mismatch.
* `DeltaS_tip(m)` is the mismatch observable defined above.
* `lambda(m)` is a convergence state factor in a bounded interval that indicates whether local reasoning about the state is convergent recursive divergent or chaotic according to TU core rules.
* `kappa` is a constant that sets the overall scale of climate tipping tension for this encoding.

The index sets for `i` and `j` reflect internal TU semantic directions and are not needed at the effective layer. It is sufficient that for each `m` in the regular domain `T_ij(m)` is finite for all relevant indices.

The receptivity factors `R_j(m)` are logically distinct from the coupling coefficients `C_ij(m)` between tipping elements. They measure how sensitive other parts of the TU or WFGY reasoning apparatus are to tipping related mismatch and they must not be confused with dynamical couplings among climate subsystems.

### 3.5 Invariants

We define two invariants using only finite maxima over fixed index sets.

1. Proximity invariant

```txt
I_prox(m) = max over i in {1,...,k} of max(0, theta_i(m))
```

This measures the worst case normalized proximity to any tipping band. Values near zero indicate that all elements are safely below their bands. Larger values indicate that at least one element is deep into its transition band or beyond.

2. Tail risk invariant

```txt
I_tail(m) = max over l in {1,...,L} of rho_tail(m; tau_l)
```

This measures the highest tail hazard across the finite set of considered time horizons.

These invariants are used to compare different states in `M` under the same encoding specification.

### 3.6 Singular set and domain restrictions

We define the singular set:

```txt
S_sing = { m in M :
           some theta_i(m) undefined,
           or some rho_tail(m; tau_l) undefined or infinite,
           or DeltaS_tip(m) undefined or infinite }
```

and the regular domain:

```txt
M_reg = M \ S_sing
```

All Q092 tension analysis is restricted to `M_reg`. If an experiment or protocol would attempt to use a state in `S_sing`, the outcome is treated as out of domain and not as evidence for or against any low or high tension world type.

---

## 4. Tension principle for this problem

This block states how Q092 is framed as a tension problem at the effective layer.

### 4.1 Core tension functional

We define the climate tipping tension functional:

```txt
Tension_tip(m) = alpha * I_prox(m)
                 + beta * I_tail(m)
                 + gamma * CascadeIndex(m)
```

where:

* `alpha`, `beta`, `gamma` are fixed positive weights chosen from the finite library `W_tip` associated with `Encoding_key: TU_BH_Q092_TIP_v1`.
* `I_prox(m)` and `I_tail(m)` are invariants defined in Section 3.5.
* `CascadeIndex(m)` is a scalar function of the normalized coupling matrix `C_ij_norm(m)` and proximity indices `theta_i(m)` that captures the potential for cascades.

A simple example choice for `CascadeIndex` is:

```txt
CascadeIndex(m) = max over i,j of (
  max(0, theta_i(m)) * max(0, C_ij_norm(m))
)
```

under the fixed normalization rule `Norm_C` bound to the encoding key. The only requirements on `CascadeIndex` at the effective layer are:

* `CascadeIndex(m) >= 0` for all `m` in `M_reg`.
* `CascadeIndex(m)` grows when strongly coupled elements that have positive effective influence are simultaneously near or beyond threshold bands.

The triple `(alpha, beta, gamma)` is part of the encoding specification. It is not tuned by scenario and any change in these values would require a new `Encoding_key`.

### 4.2 Low tension versus high tension regimes

At the effective layer Q092 distinguishes between low and high tipping tension regimes using the fixed thresholds `(epsilon_tip, delta_tip)` selected from `T_thresh`.

* Low tipping tension regimes satisfy

  ```txt
  Tension_tip(m) <= epsilon_tip
  ```

  where `epsilon_tip` is a small positive threshold specified by the encoding. In such regimes:

  * No element is close to its threshold band.
  * Tail hazard is small across all horizons in `Tau`.
  * Cascade potential remains limited.

* High tipping tension regimes satisfy

  ```txt
  Tension_tip(m) >= delta_tip
  ```

  where `delta_tip` is a strictly positive high tension threshold. In such regimes:

  * Several elements are near or beyond their threshold bands.
  * Tail hazard is large for at least one horizon in `Tau`.
  * Cascade potential is significant due to couplings.

The core tension principle for Q092 can be summarised at the effective layer as follows.

> Under some forcing trajectories described in the climate literature, state descriptions that are interpreted as representing our world move from low toward higher tipping tension regimes according to the above functional while the precise location and timing of transitions and the possibility of cascades remain highly uncertain.

This statement is a summary of existing scenario based assessments expressed in the Q092 encoding language. It is not a new physical claim derived from TU. The thresholds `epsilon_tip` and `delta_tip` are fixed by the encoding class and are chosen once for the problem.

### 4.3 Fairness and encoding stability

To guard against hidden parameter tuning we impose the following stability rules.

* Once `alpha`, `beta`, `gamma`, `epsilon_tip`, `delta_tip`, the definitions of `I_prox`, `I_tail`, `CascadeIndex`, the functional form `G`, the bands `[L_i, U_i]`, the horizon set `Tau`, and the normalization rule `Norm_C` have been fixed under `Encoding_key: TU_BH_Q092_TIP_v1`, they must be used without change for all experiments and scenarios that claim to use that key.
* Any later change to any of these choices constitutes a new encoding in `A_enc(Q092)` and must be given a new `Encoding_key`, for example `TU_BH_Q092_TIP_v2`. Results produced under different keys are not to be mixed without explicit translation.
* Comparative statements about low versus high tension regimes are only valid when all states are evaluated under the same encoding key.
* Published experiments that quote `Tension_tip(m)` must explicitly state which encoding key was used so that independent groups can reconstruct the same functional.

These conditions make it possible to falsify or refine specific encodings without blurring the distinction between different parameter choices.

---

## 5. Counterfactual tension worlds

We now describe two counterfactual worlds at the effective layer for the encoding `TU_BH_Q092_TIP_v1`.

### 5.1 World T (low tipping tension world)

In World T:

1. Proximity pattern

   * For all world representing states `m_T` in `M_reg` that correspond to realistic near term scenarios under the encoding:

     ```txt
     I_prox(m_T) is small
     ```

     meaning no major tipping element is close to its threshold band.

2. Tail hazard

   * For all `m_T` and for all `tau_l` in `Tau`:

     ```txt
     rho_tail(m_T; tau_l) is small and stable
     ```

     and under strong mitigation there may be decreasing trends in hazard.

3. Cascades

   * The cascade index `CascadeIndex(m_T)` remains low. Local threshold crossings if they occur remain relatively isolated and do not trigger large multi element cascades.

4. Global tension

   * For all relevant states `m_T`:

     ```txt
     Tension_tip(m_T) <= epsilon_tip
     ```

     so the world remains in a low tipping tension band.

### 5.2 World F (high tipping tension world)

In World F:

1. Proximity pattern

   * There exist world representing states `m_F` such that:

     ```txt
     I_prox(m_F) is moderate or large
     ```

     meaning several tipping elements are within or beyond their threshold bands.

2. Tail hazard

   * For at least one `tau_l` in `Tau` and for many states `m_F` that are consistent with observations and forcing scenarios:

     ```txt
     rho_tail(m_F; tau_l) is large
     ```

     and does not decrease as models are refined or as more data are added.

3. Cascades

   * The cascade index `CascadeIndex(m_F)` is elevated indicating that crossing one threshold significantly raises the hazard for others and that multi element cascades are plausible.

4. Global tension

   * For some minimal resolution in the encoding we have:

     ```txt
     Tension_tip(m_F) >= delta_tip
     ```

     where `delta_tip` is the high tension threshold and this value cannot be made small without changing the encoding.

### 5.3 Interpretive note

These counterfactual worlds do not describe how to generate internal TU fields from raw climate data. They only state that if we construct effective states `m` that faithfully represent the world under certain assumptions, and if we use the fixed encoding identified by `Encoding_key: TU_BH_Q092_TIP_v1`, then the resulting tension patterns would be qualitatively different between low and high tipping tension worlds.

The main purpose of these worlds is to provide a clear common language for:

* comparing different storylines about climate futures,
* testing whether a given encoding behaves in a stable and interpretable way,
* and providing reusable backdrops for downstream TU and WFGY problems.

---

## 6. Falsifiability and discriminating experiments

This block describes experiments and protocols that can falsify or support particular Q092 encodings at the effective layer. They are defined for `Encoding_key: TU_BH_Q092_TIP_v1` and they do not solve climate dynamics. They can only rule out specific tension encodings or parameterisations.

### Experiment 1: Ensemble model tension profiling

**Goal**

Test whether the chosen `Tension_tip` functional coherently reflects tipping risk across ensembles of Earth system model scenarios when all states are evaluated under `Encoding_key: TU_BH_Q092_TIP_v1`.

**Setup**

* Select an ensemble of climate model simulations for example from a coordinated model intercomparison project covering a range of forcing scenarios up to a finite time horizon `T_max`.

* For each model run and scenario define a state `m` in `M_reg` at one or more evaluation times encoding:

  * Element states `X_i(m)` and their normalized indices `theta_i(m)` using the fixed bands `[L_i, U_i]`.
  * Coupling summaries `C_ij(m)` processed through the fixed normalization rule `Norm_C` to obtain `C_ij_norm(m)`.
  * Tail hazard values `rho_tail(m; tau_l)` for `tau_l` in `Tau` based on model transition statistics.

* The mapping from model outputs into `X_i`, `theta_i`, `C_ij`, `rho_tail`, and `F(m)` belongs to the implementation layer. For this experiment it must be specified once and then held fixed for all models and scenarios that claim to use `TU_BH_Q092_TIP_v1`.

**Protocol**

1. For each state `m` from the ensemble compute

   * `I_prox(m)`,
   * `I_tail(m)`,
   * `CascadeIndex(m)`,
   * `Tension_tip(m)`.

2. Group states by scenario class for example low medium high forcing and by time slice.

3. For each group compute summary statistics of `Tension_tip(m)` and the invariants.

4. Compare these summaries to literature based expectations for low versus high climate risk scenarios.

**Metrics**

* Mean and maximum `Tension_tip(m)` per scenario and time slice.
* Fraction of states in each group with `Tension_tip(m)` above `delta_tip`.
* Trends in tension statistics as forcing increases or as mitigation is applied.

**Falsification conditions**

Under `Encoding_key: TU_BH_Q092_TIP_v1` the encoding is considered falsified or misaligned for Q092 if any of the following occur in a robust way.

* Low forcing scenarios repeatedly show `Tension_tip(m)` above `delta_tip` across most ensemble members while high forcing scenarios show `Tension_tip(m)` mostly below `epsilon_tip` with no clear physical justification for this inversion.
* Small perturbations to implementation details that remain within the bounds specified for `M_reg` and that do not change the encoding key cause arbitrarily large changes in the relative tension ranking of scenarios.
* Independent groups using the same encoding key and the same published mapping rules are unable to reproduce the qualitative ranking patterns.

**Semantics implementation note**

All quantities are treated as continuous fields as specified in the metadata. Any discretization of integrals or time averages used in numerical practice is an implementation detail outside this effective description.

**Boundary note**

Falsifying a TU encoding for Q092 under a specific `Encoding_key` does not solve the canonical climate tipping point problem and does not by itself determine real world thresholds. It only rejects one particular way of scoring tension.

---

### Experiment 2: Early warning indicators and tipping tension

**Goal**

Assess whether the Q092 tension encoding with `Encoding_key: TU_BH_Q092_TIP_v1` tracks early warning indicators of approaching tipping points in model simulations or paleoclimate records.

**Setup**

* Select time series that climate science regards as candidates for tipping behavior such as:

  * circulation strength indices,
  * ice sheet volume proxies,
  * monsoon rainfall indices,
  * key biome state indicators.

* For each time window and series compute standard early warning indicators for example:

  * rolling variance,
  * rolling lag one autocorrelation.

* For each indicator series and each time window map into a state `m` in `M_reg` by:

  * setting `X_i(m)` from the observed or simulated indicator,
  * computing `theta_i(m)` relative to the fixed bands `[L_i, U_i]`,
  * setting `rho_tail(m; tau_l)` using a simple model that interprets early warning signals as increased hazard,
  * keeping `C_ij_norm(m)` invariant or slowly varying according to the fixed encoding specification.

The mapping from early warning statistics to `theta_i` and `rho_tail` is chosen once for this encoding and used for all series and time windows.

**Protocol**

1. For each time window compute `theta_i(m)`, `rho_tail(m; tau_l)` for relevant `tau_l`, and then `Tension_tip(m)`.
2. Plot or tabulate the evolution of `Tension_tip(m)` alongside early warning indicators for each series.
3. Identify whether increases in early warning indicators correspond to consistent increases in `Tension_tip(m)` under the chosen encoding.

**Metrics**

* Correlation between `Tension_tip(m)` and early warning indicators over time.
* Frequency with which known precursor periods to suspected tipping events show rising tension.
* Rate of false positives where tension rises but no tipping or regime shift occurs in the record.

**Falsification conditions**

Under `Encoding_key: TU_BH_Q092_TIP_v1` the encoding is considered misaligned and rejected for Q092 if:

* Early warning indicators rise sharply for multiple independent cases but `Tension_tip(m)` remains low or oscillates with no clear structure even when the mapping from early warning statistics to `theta_i` and `rho_tail` respects the fixed specification.
* `Tension_tip(m)` shows frequent strong spikes in periods where domain experts see no evidence of tipping or precursor behavior and this pattern persists across multiple records and implementations.

**Semantics implementation note**

The encoding treats both early warning statistics and tipping tension as continuous valued observables consistent with the metadata field type. No change of semantic category is introduced by this experiment.

**Boundary note**

As in Experiment 1 falsifying the encoding under this experiment does not solve the canonical climate tipping problem. It only rejects a particular way of converting early warning signals into tension scores.

## 7. AI and WFGY engineering spec

This block describes how Q092 can be used in AI systems within WFGY at the effective layer while respecting the encoding key.

### 7.1 Training signals

We define several training signals suitable for supervising or regularizing AI models.

1. `signal_tipping_proximity_consistency`

   * Definition: a penalty proportional to `I_prox(m)` for states associated with narratives that claim the system is far from tipping while element descriptions place several `theta_i(m)` inside or beyond their bands.
   * Use: reduce contradictions where the model simultaneously asserts safety and describes multiple elements as near their thresholds.

2. `signal_cascade_risk_alignment`

   * Definition: a signal built from `CascadeIndex(m)` for scenarios where text or data indicate strong coupling and potential cascades.
   * Use: encourage the model to represent highly coupled tipping situations as high cascade risk not as independent events.

3. `signal_scenario_tension_profile`

   * Definition: uses `Tension_tip(m)` as a scalar target or auxiliary prediction for scenario descriptions.
   * Use: guide the model toward coherent ranking of scenarios according to their climate tipping risk.

4. `signal_world_T_vs_world_F_separation`

   * Definition: a signal that encourages distinct internal representations for low tension world descriptions and high tension world descriptions when both are presented as counterfactuals constructed under the same encoding key.
   * Use: avoid collapsing qualitatively different climate futures into a single ambiguous representation.

These signals can be used in multi objective training where climate focused modules are asked to be both factually accurate and tension aware.

### 7.2 Architectural patterns

We outline module patterns that can reuse Q092 structures without exposing any TU deep layer details.

1. `TippingElementHead`

   * Role: given a text description or structured scenario input produce estimates of `theta_i(m)` for the fixed tipping element library associated with `Encoding_key: TU_BH_Q092_TIP_v1`.
   * Interface:

     * Inputs: scenario embeddings or structured summaries.
     * Outputs: a fixed dimension vector of normalized proximity indices.

2. `CascadeRiskAggregator`

   * Role: compute `CascadeIndex(m)` and `Tension_tip(m)` from predicted `theta_i(m)`, normalized couplings `C_ij_norm(m)`, and tail hazard estimates `rho_tail(m; tau_l)`.
   * Interface:

     * Inputs: internal representations mapped to these observables.
     * Outputs: scalar scores fed to loss functions or used for interpretation and filtering.

3. `ScenarioComparator`

   * Role: given two or more scenario descriptions produce comparative judgments with respect to Q092 tension supported by the above modules.
   * Interface:

     * Inputs: multiple scenario embeddings.
     * Outputs: relative tension rankings and short structured rationales for which scenarios are closer to high tipping tension regimes.

### 7.3 Evaluation harness

A minimal evaluation harness for AI models using Q092 components.

1. Task design

   * Construct a benchmark of climate scenario descriptions where domain experts have qualitative expectations about tipping risk ranking for example higher risk under strong forcing and lower risk under strong mitigation.

2. Conditions

   * Baseline condition:

     * The model answers questions without explicit Q092 modules.
     * Answers are judged on correctness internal consistency and clarity.

   * TU enhanced condition:

     * The model uses `TippingElementHead` and `CascadeRiskAggregator` to compute `Tension_tip(m)` under `Encoding_key: TU_BH_Q092_TIP_v1`.
     * High tension answers can be revised or explicitly marked as high risk or high uncertainty.

3. Metrics

   * Accuracy of scenario ranking relative to expert judgments.
   * Internal consistency measured as the frequency of logically incompatible statements about tipping risk across related questions.
   * Stability measured as the frequency with which small perturbations in the scenario description lead to moderate rather than extreme changes in predicted tension.

### 7.4 60 second reproduction protocol

A simple test for users to experience the impact of Q092 encoding.

* Baseline setup:

  * Prompt the model:
    “Explain what climate tipping points are and how they matter for future climate risk.”
  * Record whether the explanation:

    * mixes up local and systemic tipping,
    * omits thresholds and cascades,
    * gives inconsistent statements about reversibility or risk.

* TU encoded setup:

  * Prompt the model:
    “Explain what climate tipping points are and how they matter for future climate risk, using a framework where each tipping element has a proximity index, fixed couplings, and a scalar tension score that grows when many elements approach their thresholds and cascades become likely.”
  * Record whether the explanation:

    * explicitly organises around tipping elements thresholds couplings and tail risk,
    * presents a clearer description of systemic risk and cascades.

* Comparison metric:

  * Use a simple rubric based on structure completeness and internal consistency.
  * Optionally ask independent judges which answer better captures important aspects of climate tipping.

* What to log:

  * Prompts and full responses.
  * Any auxiliary `Tension_tip(m)` values that the system can expose under the chosen encoding key.

All of this stays at the effective layer and does not reveal any TU deep layer generative rule.

## 8. Cross problem transfer template

This block describes reusable components from Q092 and where they transfer inside the BlackHole graph.

### 8.1 Reusable components produced by this problem

1. ComponentName: `TippingElementLibrary`

   * Type: field

   * Minimal interface:

     * Inputs: scenario description or structured climate state summary.
     * Outputs: a fixed dimension vector of element states and proximity indices `(X_i, theta_i)` for each `E_i` in the library associated with `Encoding_key: TU_BH_Q092_TIP_v1`.

   * Preconditions:

     * The scenario must specify climate conditions and time horizons clearly enough to assign consistent indices.
     * The same encoding key must be used across all applications that claim to reuse this component.

2. ComponentName: `ClimateTensionFunctional_CTP`

   * Type: functional

   * Minimal interface:

     * Inputs: `theta_i`, `C_ij_norm`, `rho_tail(m; tau_l)` for `tau_l` in `Tau` under the fixed encoding key.
     * Output: a nonnegative scalar `Tension_tip`.

   * Preconditions:

     * All inputs refer to states in `M_reg` for the same encoding.
     * Observables are finite and defined for the given state.

3. ComponentName: `EarlyWarningToTensionMapper`

   * Type: experiment_pattern

   * Minimal interface:

     * Inputs: time series of indicators and associated early warning statistics.
     * Outputs: approximate trajectories of `theta_i` and `Tension_tip` over time for the fixed encoding key.

   * Preconditions:

     * Time series are long enough to compute stable early warning statistics.
     * Indicator to element mapping is specified once and fixed for the duration of the experiment.

### 8.2 Direct reuse targets

1. Target: Q093 (full carbon cycle feedbacks)

   * Reused components: `TippingElementLibrary`, `ClimateTensionFunctional_CTP`.
   * Why it transfers: carbon feedbacks can be treated as one of the tipping elements whose state and hazard directly influence overall climate tension.
   * What changes: forcing descriptions and element definitions are extended to include explicit carbon pools and fluxes but the functional structure stays the same.

2. Target: Q098 (Anthropocene system dynamics)

   * Reused components: `TippingElementLibrary`, `ClimateTensionFunctional_CTP`, `EarlyWarningToTensionMapper`.
   * Why it transfers: human Earth system codynamics can be modelled as interacting tipping elements where climate subsystems form a subset.
   * What changes: the element library grows to include socio economic and technological tipping elements while climate elements retain their Q092 definitions and encoding key.

3. Target: Q105 (prediction of systemic crashes)

   * Reused components: `ClimateTensionFunctional_CTP`.
   * Why it transfers: risk tail tension in financial or infrastructural networks can be encoded with a function that mirrors the climate tipping tension structure.
   * What changes: the semantics of `theta_i`, `C_ij_norm`, and `rho_tail` shift from climate variables to network or market variables while the structural role of the functional is preserved.

## 9. TU roadmap and verification levels

This block situates Q092 on the TU verification ladder and outlines next steps.

### 9.1 Current levels

* E_level: E1

  * A coherent effective layer encoding has been specified under `Encoding_key: TU_BH_Q092_TIP_v1` with:

    * a finite tipping element library,
    * well defined observables and invariants,
    * a tension functional `Tension_tip(m)`,
    * a singular set `S_sing` and domain restriction,
    * finite libraries of allowed weights thresholds and functional forms.

  * At least two concrete experiments with explicit falsification conditions have been outlined.

* N_level: N1

  * The narrative connecting tipping elements thresholds couplings hazard and systemic tension is explicit and self consistent at a qualitative level.
  * Counterfactual low and high tension worlds have been described in terms of the same observables under the fixed encoding key.

### 9.2 Next measurable steps toward E2 and N2

To reach E2 for Q092 under `Encoding_key: TU_BH_Q092_TIP_v1` at least one of the following should be implemented.

1. A working tool that:

   * reads standardised datasets for model ensembles or indicator time series,
   * constructs states `m_data` in `M_reg` according to the published mapping rules,
   * computes `Tension_tip(m_data)` over the chosen horizons and scenarios,
   * publishes the resulting tension profiles and encoding parameters.

2. A model ensemble analysis that:

   * uses `ClimateTensionFunctional_CTP` on a multi model ensemble,
   * documents how tension scores distribute between scenarios that domain experts judge as higher and lower risk,
   * demonstrates reproducibility by independent groups using the same encoding key.

To reach N2:

* Fix a public catalog that lists:

  * the element library `E_i` and their threshold bands `[L_i, U_i]`,
  * the fixed coupling adjacency and sign structure for `C_ij`,
  * the horizon set `Tau`,
  * the selected functional form `G`,
  * the selected normalization rule `Norm_C`,
  * the selected weight triple `(alpha, beta, gamma)` and thresholds `(epsilon_tip, delta_tip)`.

* Demonstrate on at least one benchmark that the encoding produces tension rankings that align reasonably with domain expert judgments for a diversity of scenarios.

### 9.3 Long term role in TU

In the long term Q092 is expected to:

* Serve as the central Earth system node for risk tail tension questions.
* Provide reusable components for downstream problems in socio technical systems that depend on climate stability.
* Act as a bridge between physical climate risk early warning indicators and AI models that are tasked with reasoning about climate futures in a transparent and falsifiable way.

## 10. Elementary but precise explanation

In simple terms climate tipping points are places in the climate system where a small additional push can trigger a big and mostly one way change.

Examples include:

* An ice sheet that once it melts past a certain point keeps shrinking even if warming slows.
* An ocean circulation pattern that once weakened enough flips to a different mode.
* A rainforest that once it loses enough trees or receives much less rain shifts toward a savanna like state.

In this Q092 framing we do not try to simulate the full climate system. Instead we do three things at the effective layer.

1. We list a finite set of important climate pieces that can tip.
   For each piece we define:

   * a number that tells us where it sits relative to a dangerous band,
   * a description of how it is coupled to the other pieces,
   * a simple summary of how likely it is to tip within certain time windows.

2. We combine these into a tension score:

   * If all pieces are far from their dangerous bands the tail hazard is small and the couplings are weak the tipping tension score is low.
   * If many pieces are close to their bands tail hazard is large and couplings are strong the tipping tension score is high, especially when one piece tipping would make others more likely to tip.

3. We define experiments that test whether this score behaves in a reasonable way:

   * In model ensembles high forcing scenarios should not look safer than low forcing scenarios under the same encoding.
   * Early warning signals of tipping should usually show up as increasing tension in our score though not every fluctuation should count as a warning.

This approach does not predict exact tipping times and it does not claim to know the true thresholds of real world systems. It does something more limited and more testable:

* It gives a clear list of observables to watch.
* It provides a way to falsify bad scoring rules.
* It creates building blocks that other problems and AI systems can reuse when they need to talk carefully about climate tipping and systemic risk.

Q092 is therefore the place in the Tension Universe where climate tipping points are turned from a loose metaphor into a precise tension problem that can be encoded tested and connected to many other questions.

## Tension Universe effective-layer footer

This page is part of the WFGY / Tension Universe S problem collection.

### Scope of claims

* The goal of this document is to specify an effective layer encoding of the climate tipping point problem identified as Q092 under the BlackHole S problem scheme.
* It does not claim to prove or disprove the canonical scientific statements about climate tipping points reviewed in Section 1.
* It does not introduce any new theorem inequality or numerical bound beyond what is already established in the cited literature.
* It must not be cited as evidence that the corresponding scientific problem has been solved or that specific real world thresholds have been determined.

### Effective-layer boundary

* All objects used here state spaces `M`, finite tipping element libraries, observables, invariants, tension scores, and counterfactual worlds live only at the effective layer of the Tension Universe framework.
* No deep layer TU axiom system generating rule or ontology is specified in this document.
* Any mapping from raw climate data or climate model output into the effective layer objects described here belongs to the implementation layer and is outside the scope of this page.
* The encoding described here is compatible with multiple physical models and data sources and it is not tied to any one simulation code or dataset.

### Encoding and fairness

* The encoding described in Sections 3 and 4 is identified by `Encoding_key: TU_BH_Q092_TIP_v1` and belongs to a finite admissible class of encodings for Q092.
* Choices of element library threshold bands horizon sets functional forms weight triples and tension thresholds are taken from finite libraries and are fixed once for this key.
* Any change to these choices defines a new encoding key and must not be presented as a result obtained under `TU_BH_Q092_TIP_v1`.
* All experiments comparisons and AI modules that claim to use this encoding must state the encoding key and must apply the same specification to all states being compared.

### Falsifiability

* The experiments and protocols in Section 6 define concrete ways in which specific encodings under the Q092 encoding key can be rejected when confronted with model ensembles data and expert judgments.
* Falsifying an encoding under these experiments does not falsify climate science and does not by itself determine the true structure of climate tipping points.
* Passing these experiments means only that the encoding has survived the specified tests. It does not by itself validate any further use outside the conditions that were tested.

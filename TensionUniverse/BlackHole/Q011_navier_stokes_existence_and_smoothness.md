## 1. Canonical problem and status

### 1.1 Canonical statement

The incompressible Navier–Stokes equations in three space dimensions describe the motion of a viscous, incompressible fluid. On a standard domain such as the whole space R^3 or the three dimensional torus T^3, they can be written in vector form as

```txt
partial_t u + (u · grad) u = nu * Laplacian u - grad p
div u = 0
```

where

* `u(x,t)` is the velocity field,
* `p(x,t)` is the pressure,
* `nu > 0` is the kinematic viscosity.

Given suitable initial data `u_0(x)` with `div u_0 = 0`, one asks whether there exists a unique solution `(u,p)` that

* exists for all times `t >= 0`, and
* remains sufficiently smooth for all times.

The Clay Millennium version of the problem, in one standard formulation, asks:

> For physically reasonable three dimensional incompressible Navier–Stokes flows, do smooth, finite energy initial data always generate global in time smooth solutions, or can solutions develop singularities in finite time?

More precisely, for a standard domain (R^3 or T^3) and initial data `u_0` in an appropriate function space (for example square integrable divergence free fields), is it true that there exists a unique, smooth solution for all `t > 0` that satisfies the Navier–Stokes equations, the incompressibility condition, and an appropriate energy inequality?

The problem is to decide whether

* all such solutions remain regular for all time (global existence and smoothness), or
* there exist initial data for which solutions develop singularities in finite time (blow up).

### 1.2 Status and difficulty

In three dimensions, the global regularity of Navier–Stokes solutions with smooth initial data is unknown. Partial results include:

* Existence and uniqueness of smooth solutions on short time intervals for smooth initial data.
* Global existence and uniqueness for small data in certain function spaces.
* Global existence of weak solutions in the sense of Leray that satisfy an energy inequality, but may not be known to be smooth or unique.
* Regularity criteria that show smoothness holds under additional conditions, for example smallness of certain norms of the velocity or its gradient.
* Partial results that rule out some singularity scenarios or restrict the possible structure of singular sets.

Despite these advances, no full proof or disproof of global existence and smoothness is known in three dimensions. The problem is considered one of the most difficult open questions in analysis and mathematical fluid dynamics and is one of the official Clay Mathematics Institute Millennium Prize Problems.

### 1.3 Role in the BlackHole project

Within the BlackHole S-problem collection, Q011 plays several roles.

1. It is the primary example of a **dynamical_field** problem where a local partial differential equation must be globally consistent with energy bounds and regularity.
2. It anchors a family of problems involving finite time blow up versus global smoothness, including geometric flows, turbulence, and gravitational collapse.
3. It provides a template for encoding

   * energy and gradient based observables,
   * singular set handling,
   * low tension versus high tension scenarios for evolution equations.

## 2. Position in the BlackHole graph

This block records how Q011 sits inside the BlackHole graph as nodes and edges among Q001 to Q125. Each edge is listed with a one line reason that points to a concrete component or tension type.

### 2.1 Upstream problems

These problems provide prerequisites, tools, or general foundations that Q011 relies on at the effective layer.

* Q017 (BH_MATH_GEOM_FLOW_L3_017)
  Reason: supplies regularity and singularity patterns from geometric flows that shape the design of NS tension functionals for smoothness versus blow up.

* Q039 (BH_PHYS_QTURBULENCE_L3_039)
  Reason: contributes turbulence and cascade phenomenology used to define high tension worlds where energy transfer drives potential singular behavior.

* Q032 (BH_PHYS_QTHERMO_L3_032)
  Reason: provides thermodynamic style invariants reused to frame dissipation and irreversibility in NS flows as tension objects.

### 2.2 Downstream problems

These problems are direct reuse targets of Q011 components or depend on Q011 tension structures.

* Q039 (BH_PHYS_QTURBULENCE_L3_039)
  Reason: reuses the `NS_Tension_3D` functional and `FlowRegularityDescriptor` to encode tension between laminar and turbulent regimes.

* Q091 (BH_EARTH_CLIMATE_SENS_L3_091)
  Reason: depends on coarse grained NS dynamics and regularity assumptions when encoding tension between climate models and observed large scale circulation.

* Q094 (BH_EARTH_OCEAN_MIX_L3_094)
  Reason: uses NS based flow models and Q011 regularity descriptors to encode tension between predicted and observed mixing in deep oceans.

### 2.3 Parallel problems

Parallel nodes share similar tension types but no direct component dependence.

* Q001 (BH_MATH_RIEMANN_L3_001)
  Reason: both Q001 and Q011 are governed by consistency_tension between strict local laws and global regularity constraints, using singular sets and domain restriction.

* Q020 (BH_MATH_HIGH_D_GEOM_L3_020)
  Reason: both involve classification of global behavior under curvature or energy constraints with possible formation of singular sets.

### 2.4 Cross domain edges

Cross domain edges connect Q011 to problems in other domains that can reuse its components.

* Q040 (BH_PHYS_QBLACKHOLE_INFO_L3_040)
  Reason: reuses the blow up versus smooth world template for gravitational collapse and horizon formation.

* Q105 (BH_COMPLEX_CRASHES_L3_105)
  Reason: imports the finite time blow up versus controlled evolution tension pattern as an analogy for systemic crashes in complex networks.

## 3. Tension Universe encoding (effective layer)

All content in this block is at the effective layer. We describe

* state spaces,
* observables and fields,
* invariants and tension scores,
* singular sets and domain restrictions.

We do not describe any hidden generative rules or any explicit construction of internal TU fields from raw data.

### 3.1 Encoding precommit for Q011

This subsection records the precommitted encoding choices for Q011 in a way that can be audited without exposing deep TU structure.

```txt
EncodingKey_Q011          = TU_BH_NS_v1
LibraryKey_Q011_energy    = TU_NS_ENERGY_LIB_v1
LibraryKey_Q011_grad      = TU_NS_GRAD_LIB_v1
WeightKey_Q011            = TU_NS_WEIGHT_SET_v1
RefPairKey_Q011           = TU_NS_REFPAIR_v1
RefinementKey_Q011        = TU_NS_REFINE_SCHEME_v1
TensionScaleKey_Q011      = TU_TENSION_SCALE_v1
```

These keys are interpreted as follows.

* Each key refers to a finite family of admissible choices defined at the charter level, in particular in the TU Effective Layer Charter, the TU Encoding and Fairness Charter, and the TU Tension Scale Charter.
* For this version of Q011, a single element is selected from each finite family and bound to the corresponding key.
* Once this file is published, the mapping from keys to concrete choices is frozen for this version of Q011. Any change requires a new `EncodingKey_Q011` and a new version of this file.

No information in this subsection claims anything about the truth value of the Navier–Stokes existence and smoothness problem. It records only effective layer encoding commitments.

### 3.2 State space

We assume the existence of a state space

```txt
M
```

with the following effective interpretation.

* Each element `m` in `M` represents a coherent finite resolution “flow world configuration” for three dimensional incompressible Navier–Stokes on a standard domain such as R^3 or T^3.
* A state `m` encodes summaries of

  * initial velocity field at a chosen resolution,
  * evolution summaries over one or more finite time windows,
  * energy and enstrophy levels,
  * gradient magnitude statistics,
  * coarse indicators of regularity or possible singular behavior.

We do not specify how such states are constructed from numerical simulations or proofs. We only assume that for any physically reasonable NS scenario and time window of interest, there exist states in `M` that encode the corresponding summaries.

### 3.3 Data sources and lift to state space

To make the encoding auditable, we distinguish two classes of input data and describe how they are lifted to states in `M` at the effective layer.

1. Numerical NS data

   * Domain: standard domains such as T^3 or large periodic boxes approximating R^3.
   * Data: numerical solutions of incompressible Navier–Stokes with smooth divergence free initial data and specified viscosity `nu`.
   * Resolution ladder: a finite sequence of grid or spectral resolutions indexed by an integer `k` in a fixed finite set `K_NS`. The mapping from `k` to numerical resolution parameters is defined at the charter level and referenced by `RefinementKey_Q011`.

2. Toy PDE data

   * Family S: PDE models with known global existence and smoothness for suitable initial data, such as viscous one dimensional Burgers equations with periodic boundary conditions.
   * Family B: PDE models with known finite time blow up for some initial data, such as inviscid Burgers equations or other shock forming systems with established blow up.
   * Resolution ladder and time windows are defined analogously to the NS case.

For both classes, the lift to `M` proceeds in two steps.

1. Observable extraction

   * Starting from raw field data, one computes continuous time functions or discrete time series for

     * kinetic energy,
     * enstrophy or squared vorticity,
     * suitable norms of the velocity gradient,
     * dissipation like quantities.

   * The specific function spaces and norms used for extraction are fixed by `RefinementKey_Q011` and are chosen from finite families specified in the TU charters.

2. Summary compression

   * For each time window `T` and resolution level `k`, one compresses the extracted observables into a finite dimensional summary that includes

     * window averaged energy,
     * window averaged enstrophy,
     * peak gradient indicators,
     * coarse dissipation statistics.

   * These summaries, together with metadata about the underlying model family and initial data class, define the effective state `m` in `M`.

The lift is required to be deterministic once the charter level choices and the encoding keys in 3.1 are fixed. It does not depend on any guess about the truth of the Navier–Stokes existence and smoothness problem.

### 3.4 Effective observables

We introduce the following effective observables on `M`. All of them are maps into real or vector valued quantities in the TU continuous parameter space.

1. Kinetic energy observable

   ```txt
   E_kin(m; T, k) >= 0
   ```

   * Input: state `m`, time window `T`, and resolution level `k` in `K_NS`.
   * Output: a nonnegative scalar summarizing the kinetic energy level of the flow encoded in `m` over `T` at resolution level `k`.

2. Enstrophy observable

   ```txt
   Omega(m; T, k) >= 0
   ```

   * Input: state `m`, time window `T`, and resolution level `k`.
   * Output: a nonnegative scalar summarizing the enstrophy or squared vorticity level over `T` at resolution level `k`.

3. Gradient peak observable

   ```txt
   Grad_peak(m; T, k) >= 0
   ```

   * Input: state `m`, time window `T`, and resolution level `k`.
   * Output: a nonnegative scalar summarizing the maximal velocity gradient magnitude over `T` at resolution level `k`.

4. Dissipation observable

   ```txt
   Diss(m; T, k)
   ```

   * Input: state `m`, time window `T`, and resolution level `k`.
   * Output: a scalar summarizing effective energy dissipation rate over `T` at resolution level `k`.

All observables are assumed to be well defined and finite for states in the regular domain defined in 3.7.

### 3.5 Reference libraries and mismatch observables

We define mismatch observables relative to fixed reference libraries that represent behavior consistent with known energy inequalities and partial regularity results for globally smooth NS solutions. Reference objects are constructed only from established theorems and bounds in the PDE literature, not from any assumed solution of the Millennium Problem.

1. Reference libraries

   We fix finite libraries

   ```txt
   Lib_energy_Q011 = { Ref_energy_1, ..., Ref_energy_K }
   Lib_grad_Q011   = { Ref_grad_1,   ..., Ref_grad_L }
   ```

   where each `Ref_energy_k` and `Ref_grad_l` is a reference profile that assigns, for each time window `T` and resolution level `k` in `K_NS`, upper and lower bounds in the form

   ```txt
   E_kin_lower_k(T) <= E_kin <= E_kin_upper_k(T)
   Grad_peak_lower_l(T) <= Grad_peak <= Grad_peak_upper_l(T)
   ```

   These bounds must be justified entirely by known results such as

   * energy inequalities for NS,
   * global small data results in appropriate function spaces,
   * local existence and partial regularity statements.

   No reference profile is allowed to assume the conclusion of the Navier–Stokes existence and smoothness problem.

   An admissible reference pair is any element of the finite set

   ```txt
   RefPair_Q011 = Lib_energy_Q011 x Lib_grad_Q011
   ```

   For this version of Q011, a single pair

   ```txt
   (Ref_energy*, Ref_grad*)
   ```

   is selected from `RefPair_Q011` and bound to `RefPairKey_Q011`. This choice is frozen for this version and does not depend on the behavior of any particular dataset.

2. Energy mismatch observable

   ```txt
   DeltaS_energy(m; T, k) >= 0
   ```

   * Input: state `m`, time window `T`, resolution level `k`.
   * Raw quantity: the deviation of `E_kin(m; T, k)` and related energy quantities from the reference band specified by `Ref_energy*` at `(T, k)`.
   * Normalization: the raw deviation is divided by a positive scale factor derived from the width of the reference band and mapped to a dimensionless number on the TU tension scale using `TensionScaleKey_Q011`.

   By construction,

   * `DeltaS_energy(m; T, k) = 0` if the encoded energy behavior lies entirely within the reference band for `(T, k)`.
   * `DeltaS_energy(m; T, k)` increases as the energy behavior moves further outside the reference band.

3. Gradient mismatch observable

   ```txt
   DeltaS_grad(m; T, k) >= 0
   ```

   * Input: state `m`, time window `T`, resolution level `k`.
   * Raw quantity: the deviation of `Grad_peak(m; T, k)` and related gradient quantities from the reference band specified by `Ref_grad*` at `(T, k)`.
   * Normalization: the raw deviation is divided by a positive scale factor derived from the width of the reference band and mapped to a dimensionless number on the TU tension scale using `TensionScaleKey_Q011`.

   By construction,

   * `DeltaS_grad(m; T, k) = 0` if the gradient behavior lies within the reference band for `(T, k)`.
   * `DeltaS_grad(m; T, k)` increases as the gradient behavior moves further outside the reference band.

Both mismatch observables are dimensionless and live directly on the TU tension scale.

### 3.6 Combined NS mismatch and weights

We combine the mismatch observables into a single scalar mismatch

```txt
DeltaS_NS(m; T, k) = w_energy * DeltaS_energy(m; T, k)
                     + w_grad  * DeltaS_grad(m; T, k)
```

where the weights satisfy

```txt
w_energy >= 0
w_grad  >= 0
w_energy + w_grad = 1
```

The admissible weight pairs are taken from a finite set

```txt
W_NS = { (w_energy^1, w_grad^1), ..., (w_energy^R, w_grad^R) }
```

defined in the TU Encoding and Fairness Charter. For this version of Q011, one pair `(w_energy*, w_grad*)` is chosen from `W_NS` and recorded under `WeightKey_Q011`. This pair is used for all computations of `DeltaS_NS` in this file and cannot be changed without creating a new version.

`DeltaS_NS(m; T, k)` is therefore a dimensionless scalar in the TU tension scale, monotone in each mismatch component and completely determined once the precommit keys are fixed.

### 3.7 Regular domain and singular sets

Some observables or the combined mismatch may be undefined or unbounded for certain states, for example if the encoded summaries are incomplete, numerically unstable, or logically inconsistent with basic NS constraints. To handle this in a way that can be audited, we distinguish two singular sets.

1. Computational singular set

   ```txt
   S_sing_compute = {
     m in M :
       for some relevant (T, k) in K_NS x TimeWindows_NS,
       the computation of E_kin, Omega, Grad_peak, Diss,
       DeltaS_energy, DeltaS_grad, or DeltaS_NS fails,
       diverges numerically, or is not available due to
       missing data, but no logical inconsistency with
       NS equations or known inequalities is detected
   }
   ```

   States in `S_sing_compute` represent incomplete or numerically problematic data. They cannot be used to support claims about low or high NS tension. Any experiment that encounters such states must mark the corresponding evaluations as “inconclusive”.

2. Consistency singular set

   ```txt
   S_sing_consistency = {
     m in M :
       the observable summaries encoded in m violate
       known necessary conditions for solutions of the
       incompressible Navier–Stokes equations with
       finite energy, such as basic energy inequalities
       or incompressibility constraints, in a way that
       cannot be explained by numerical error bounds
   }
   ```

   States in `S_sing_consistency` are considered incompatible with any physically meaningful NS flow at the level of abstraction used here.

We then define the regular domain

```txt
M_reg = M \ (S_sing_compute ∪ S_sing_consistency)
```

All NS related tension analysis at the effective layer is restricted to `M_reg`. The following rules apply.

* States in `S_sing_compute` are treated as out of domain for tension evaluation. They provide no evidence for or against any encoding or world scenario.
* States in `S_sing_consistency` indicate that the data or model used to generate the state is inconsistent with NS constraints at the effective layer. They may be used to falsify particular encodings or data pipelines but do not resolve the Millennium Problem.

### 3.8 Interface to TU core

Q011 does not introduce any new deep layer TU objects. At the effective layer it exposes only

* the dimensionless mismatch components `DeltaS_energy(m; T, k)` and `DeltaS_grad(m; T, k)`,
* the combined mismatch `DeltaS_NS(m; T, k)`.

These quantities can be fed into TU core tension interfaces as input channels, but this file does not specify any deep layer equations or generative rules. All such behavior is governed by the TU charters.

---

## 4. Tension principle for Navier–Stokes

This block states how Q011 is characterized as a tension problem within TU at the effective layer.

### 4.1 NS tension functional

We define an effective NS tension functional

```txt
Tension_NS(m; T, k) = alpha * DeltaS_energy(m; T, k)
                      + beta  * DeltaS_grad(m; T, k)
```

where `alpha` and `beta` are positive constants chosen from a finite admissible set

```txt
A_NS = { (alpha^1, beta^1), ..., (alpha^S, beta^S) }
```

with `alpha^s > 0`, `beta^s > 0` for all `s`. For this version of Q011 one pair `(alpha*, beta*)` is fixed and recorded under `WeightKey_Q011` together with `(w_energy*, w_grad*)`. The function `Tension_NS` is then completely determined by

* the mismatch observables,
* the precommitted weights and coefficients.

By construction

* `Tension_NS(m; T, k) >= 0` for all `m` in `M_reg`,
* `Tension_NS(m; T, k)` is small when both mismatch observables are small,
* `Tension_NS(m; T, k)` grows monotonically when either mismatch observable grows while the encoding is held fixed.

### 4.2 Encoding class and fairness constraints

The admissible encoding class for Q011 is defined by the finite objects

* `Lib_energy_Q011`, `Lib_grad_Q011`,
* `RefPair_Q011`,
* `W_NS`, `A_NS`,
* the finite set of refinement schemes associated with `RefinementKey_Q011`,
* the TU tension scale associated with `TensionScaleKey_Q011`.

Fairness constraints.

1. All of these finite families are defined at the charter level and are shared across multiple problems where appropriate. Q011 selects one concrete element from each family and records the selection through the keys in 3.1.
2. The selection is made without reference to any particular NS dataset, numerical simulation, or toy model instance. It is made at the level of method design and remains fixed for this version of Q011.
3. Once the selection is made and the encoding key is published, it cannot be adjusted in response to tension outputs on individual data instances. If empirical evidence shows that the encoding is inadequate, the remedy is to declare this encoding falsified at the effective layer and design a new encoding with a new key and new version of the file.

These constraints implement the “no post hoc parameter tuning” requirement at the effective layer.

### 4.3 NS as a low tension principle

At the effective layer, the Navier–Stokes existence and smoothness conjecture is interpreted as follows.

> In world scenarios that faithfully reflect the true behavior of three dimensional incompressible Navier–Stokes flows, and for an admissible encoding from the class above, there exist flows whose encoded states remain within controlled NS tension bands across refinement levels and time windows that precede any candidate singularity time.

More concretely, for a fixed admissible encoding and a collection of world representing states `m_S` associated with globally smooth NS flows, we expect that

* for each resolution level `k` in `K_NS` and each relevant time window `T`, there exists a bound `epsilon_NS(k, T)` such that

  ```txt
  Tension_NS(m_S; T, k) <= epsilon_NS(k, T)
  ```

* the bounds `epsilon_NS(k, T)` remain compatible with known energy inequalities and regularity criteria and do not exhibit uncontrolled divergence when `k` increases in the specified refinement scheme.

This is an effective layer statement only. It does not assert that such flows have been constructed or that any particular encoding realizes the conjectured behavior.

### 4.4 NS failure as persistent high tension

If there exist physically relevant flows that develop singularities in finite time, then for any encoding in the admissible class that remains faithful to the actual behavior of those flows there should exist states `m_B` and refinement levels `k` such that

```txt
Tension_NS(m_B; T_0, k) >= delta_NS
```

for some time window `T_0` and some positive constant `delta_NS` that cannot be made arbitrarily small while the encoding remains faithful to the observable behavior.

In this way, at the effective layer, Q011 is represented as a choice between

* a world pattern where relevant flows can be encoded in persistently low NS tension bands under refinement, and
* a world pattern where some flows inevitably produce persistent high tension signatures under any faithful encoding.

No claim is made here that such an encoding has been found or that the real universe must match either world pattern.

---

## 5. Counterfactual tension worlds

We outline two counterfactual worlds that describe observable tension patterns without constructing NS solutions. These worlds are templates in the effective layer only.

* World S: global smoothness holds for all relevant NS flows.
* World B: finite time blow up occurs for some NS flows.

### 5.1 World S: global smoothness template

In World S the following properties are expected to hold for world representing states `m_S` and refinement levels `k` in `K_NS`.

1. Energy and enstrophy behavior

   * For each time window `T`, the observables `E_kin(m_S; T, k)` and `Omega(m_S; T, k)` remain within the reference bands of `Ref_energy*` up to deviations that are compatible with numerical or modeling uncertainty.
   * Under refinement, the family of energy and enstrophy bands remains consistent with known global energy bounds and partial regularity results.

2. Gradient behavior

   * The observable `Grad_peak(m_S; T, k)` remains within the gradient bands of `Ref_grad*` for all `k` up to small deviations allowed by the encoding.
   * When gradients become large at fine scales, they do so in ways consistent with smooth solutions and with known regularity criteria, rather than showing unbounded growth incompatible with any such criteria.

3. NS tension profile

   * For each `(T, k)` one can find a control function `epsilon_NS(k, T)` such that

     ```txt
     Tension_NS(m_S; T, k) <= epsilon_NS(k, T)
     ```

   * The collection of bounds `epsilon_NS(k, T)` does not exhibit unexpected explosive growth when `k` increases and remains compatible with smooth world expectations.

This template does not assert that global smoothness is true. It describes how the effective layer observables and NS tension would behave if global smoothness holds.

### 5.2 World B: finite time blow up template

In World B the following behavior is expected for some flows represented by states `m_B`.

1. Energy and enstrophy anomalies

   * For certain time windows near a candidate blow up time, the observables `E_kin(m_B; T, k)` and `Omega(m_B; T, k)` display patterns that cannot fit into any energy reference band derived from known smoothness compatible inequalities, across refinement levels.

2. Gradient anomalies

   * For some refinement levels `k` and windows `T` the gradient observable `Grad_peak(m_B; T, k)` exceeds any range compatible with known smoothness criteria within a finite time range.
   * Under refinement, these anomalies remain persistent rather than being absorbed into redefinitions of the reference bands.

3. NS tension profile

   * There exist `T_0` and `k_0` such that

     ```txt
     Tension_NS(m_B; T_0, k) >= delta_NS
     ```

     for all `k >= k_0` with a positive `delta_NS` that cannot be reduced to zero without ceasing to be faithful to the observable behavior.

Again, this template does not produce singular NS solutions. It specifies how an effective layer encoding would see persistent high NS tension if finite time blow up is part of the real world.

### 5.3 Interpretive note

World S and World B are purely effective layer constructs.

* They do not require or provide constructions of NS solutions or singularities.
* They are not proofs or disproofs of the canonical statement.
* They exist to organize observable summaries and NS tension patterns under different hypothetical global behaviors.

---

## 6. Falsifiability and discriminating experiments

This block specifies experiments and protocols that can

* test whether the Q011 encoding is coherent and stable, and
* distinguish between acceptable and unacceptable encodings within the admissible class.

These experiments cannot solve or disprove the Navier–Stokes existence and smoothness problem. They can only falsify or support specific effective layer encodings.

### Experiment 1: Numerical NS tension profiling

**Goal**

Test whether the chosen mismatch observables and NS tension functional behave stably and meaningfully on ensembles of high resolution numerical simulations of three dimensional incompressible NS flows that are believed to remain smooth over the simulated time.

**Setup**

* Select a finite family of numerical NS simulations on T^3 or a similar periodic domain with

  * smooth divergence free initial data,
  * a range of viscosities and Reynolds numbers,
  * simulation time intervals that are believed to remain in the smooth regime.

* Fix in advance

  * a reference pair `(Ref_energy*, Ref_grad*)` from `RefPair_Q011`,
  * a weight pair `(w_energy*, w_grad*)` from `W_NS`,
  * coefficients `(alpha*, beta*)` from `A_NS`,
  * a refinement scheme `refine*(k)` determined by `RefinementKey_Q011`,
  * a set of time windows `T_1, ..., T_M` that cover the simulated interval.

**Protocol**

1. For each simulation and each refinement level `k` in the finite set determined by `refine*`, construct states `m_data(k)` in `M` via the lift described in 3.3 and 3.4.

2. For each state `m_data(k)` and each time window `T_j`, check whether `m_data(k)` lies in `S_sing_compute` or `S_sing_consistency`. If so, record the reason and mark this pair `(T_j, k)` as inconclusive or inconsistent as appropriate.

3. For each `(T_j, k)` with `m_data(k)` in `M_reg`, compute

   * `DeltaS_energy(m_data(k); T_j, k)`,
   * `DeltaS_grad(m_data(k); T_j, k)`,
   * `DeltaS_NS(m_data(k); T_j, k)`,
   * `Tension_NS(m_data(k); T_j, k)`.

4. For each `(T_j, k)` collect the distribution of `Tension_NS` over simulations.

**Metrics**

* For each `(T_j, k)`:

  * empirical mean, variance, and quantiles of `Tension_NS`,
  * maximum and minimum observed `Tension_NS`.

* Stability measures:

  * compare distributions when passing from resolution `k` to `k'` in the refinement scheme,
  * track whether tension behaves in a controlled way consistent with smooth world expectations.

**Falsification conditions**

The current Q011 encoding is considered falsified at the effective layer if one of the following holds.

1. For multiple simulations that are widely believed to remain smooth in the simulated time range, and for many `(T_j, k)` pairs, `Tension_NS` values systematically exceed any tension bands that can be justified from known smoothness compatible bounds, even after accounting for numerical uncertainties, while the reference libraries are themselves constructed only from those bounds.
2. Small perturbations of the encoding within the admissible class (for example switching to another reference pair in `RefPair_Q011` or another `(alpha, beta)` pair in `A_NS`) cause large, erratic swings in `Tension_NS` that cannot be explained by the change in encoding and that break basic smooth world expectations.

In such cases the conclusion is

* “the Q011 encoding with key `EncodingKey_Q011` is rejected at the effective layer for NS smooth world interpretation”,

not

* “the Navier–Stokes existence and smoothness problem is resolved in any direction”.

### Experiment 2: Toy model separation of smooth versus blow up

**Goal**

Check whether the NS tension encoding correctly distinguishes between toy PDE models with known global smoothness and toy models with known finite time blow up.

**Setup**

* Select two toy model families.

  * Family S: PDEs with known global existence and smoothness for appropriate initial data, such as viscous periodic Burgers equations.
  * Family B: PDEs with known finite time blow up or shock formation for some initial data, such as inviscid Burgers equations or similar one dimensional models.

* For each family choose a finite set of initial conditions from a standard class.

* Use analytic results and numerical simulations to generate observable summaries for both families over time intervals that cover the relevant smooth or blow up behavior.

**Protocol**

1. For each model in Family S and Family B and each chosen initial condition, generate solution data over the specified time interval.
2. For a finite set of time windows `T_1, ..., T_M` and refinement levels `k` determined by `RefinementKey_Q011`, construct states in `M` using the same lift procedure as in Experiment 1.
3. Evaluate `DeltaS_energy`, `DeltaS_grad`, `DeltaS_NS`, and `Tension_NS` under the Q011 encoding for all states in `M_reg`.
4. For each family and each `(T_j, k)` collect the distribution of `Tension_NS`.

**Metrics**

* Separation of tension distributions between Family S and Family B, measured by

  * difference of means or medians,
  * overlap of quantile ranges,
  * simple divergence measures between empirical distributions.

* Robustness of separation under limited changes of admissible encoding within the fixed finite families `RefPair_Q011`, `W_NS`, and `A_NS`.

**Falsification conditions**

The current Q011 encoding is considered misaligned and rejected for NS regularity analysis if one of the following holds.

1. For many `(T_j, k)` near the known blow up times in Family B and away from any singular behavior in Family S, the distributions of `Tension_NS` for Family B systematically lie below those for Family S, in contradiction to the intended interpretation of high NS tension as signaling blow up compatible behavior.
2. No meaningful statistical separation between Family S and Family B can be achieved for any choice of encoding inside the finite admissible class, indicating that the structure of `DeltaS_NS` and `Tension_NS` is inadequate to capture even simple blow up versus smooth distinctions.

Again, such failures falsify the current encoding at the effective layer; they do not change the canonical truth value of the Navier–Stokes existence and smoothness problem.

## 7. AI and WFGY engineering spec

This block describes how Q011 can be used as an engineering module for AI systems within the WFGY framework at the effective layer.

### 7.1 Training signals

We define training signals derived from NS tension observables that can be used to shape AI reasoning without providing any NS proofs.

1. `signal_NS_energy_stability`

   * Definition: a penalty proportional to `DeltaS_energy(m; T, k)` when the model is reasoning in contexts where global NS energy behavior is assumed.
   * Purpose: discourage reasoning trajectories that imply energy growth patterns incompatible with standard NS energy inequalities.

2. `signal_NS_gradient_safety`

   * Definition: a signal based on `DeltaS_grad(m; T, k)` that increases when the model’s internal representations suggest unrealistic gradient growth while simultaneously assuming smooth flows.
   * Purpose: encourage the model to maintain coherent assumptions about regularity.

3. `signal_NS_tension`

   * Definition: direct use of `Tension_NS(m; T, k)` as a scalar tension indicator attached to internal states associated with NS reasoning.
   * Purpose: allow the model to treat NS analysis as high or low tension depending on how far its implicit assumptions drift from smoothness compatible patterns.

4. `signal_counterfactual_separation_NS`

   * Definition: a signal that measures how consistently the model keeps its reasoning about NS separated between prompts that treat global smoothness as an assumption and prompts that treat finite time blow up as a possibility.
   * Purpose: avoid mixing conclusions that require incompatible global assumptions in a single reasoning chain.

### 7.2 Architectural patterns

We outline module patterns that reuse Q011 structures without exposing any deep TU generative rules.

1. `NS_TensionHead`

   * Role: given an internal representation of a fluid dynamics context, produce an estimate of `Tension_NS(m; T, k)` and its decomposition into energy and gradient components.
   * Interface: takes embeddings associated with NS contexts as input and outputs scalar tension and a small vector of tension components.

2. `RegularityGuard_NS`

   * Role: examine proposed reasoning steps or candidate outputs that involve statements about NS existence, uniqueness, or regularity and flag those that imply unrealistic behavior relative to the Q011 encoding.
   * Interface: consumes internal representations and proposed statements, outputs a soft mask or confidence adjustment based on NS tension signals.

3. `TU_FlowField_Observer`

   * Role: map internal representations into coarse summaries of energy and gradient quantities that match the interface expected by the observables in 3.4.
   * Interface: from embeddings to a finite dimensional feature vector representing `E_kin`, `Omega`, `Grad_peak`, and `Diss`.

### 7.3 Evaluation harness

We describe an evaluation harness to test AI models augmented with Q011 modules.

1. Task selection

   * Build or select a benchmark of questions about

     * basic NS theory (energy inequalities, weak versus strong solutions),
     * the Millennium Problem statement,
     * scenarios that require understanding of potential blow up versus global regularity.

2. Conditions

   * Baseline condition: model operates without Q011 specific modules or training signals.
   * TU condition: model uses NS tension signals and Q011 modules as auxiliary components during reasoning.

3. Metrics

   * Accuracy on questions about standard NS theory that do not require solving the Millennium Problem.
   * Consistency of answers across prompts that assume global smoothness versus prompts that assume possible blow up.
   * Rate at which the model correctly recognizes that certain claims would require solving Q011 and therefore must be treated as speculative.

### 7.4 Sixty second reproduction protocol

A minimal protocol for external users to experience the effect of Q011 encoding in an AI system.

* Baseline setup

  * Prompt: ask the AI to explain the Navier–Stokes existence and smoothness problem and its relation to turbulence, without any mention of tension or TU.
  * Observation: note whether the explanation is fragmented, vague about regularity, or incorrectly suggests that the problem is already solved.

* TU encoded setup

  * Prompt: ask the same question but explicitly instruct the AI to structure the answer around

    * local NS equations,
    * energy and gradient observables,
    * low tension versus high tension scenarios for global regularity.

  * Observation: note whether the explanation clearly separates what is known from what is unknown and uses NS tension language to organize the discussion.

* Comparison metric

  * Use a simple rubric to rate clarity, correctness, and separation between established results and open conjectures in both setups.
  * Optionally ask independent evaluators to choose which explanation better reflects current mathematical understanding.

* What to log

  * Prompts, full responses, and any auxiliary NS tension values produced by Q011 modules.
  * These logs allow later analysis of the encoding’s behavior without revealing any deep TU generative rules.

## 8. Cross problem transfer template

This block lists reusable components produced by Q011 and explains how they transfer to other problems.

### 8.1 Reusable components

1. ComponentName: `NS_Tension_3D`

   * Type: functional

   * Interface:

     * Inputs: `flow_state_summary`, `time_window`, `resolution_level`
     * Output: scalar `tension_value` representing `Tension_NS(flow_state_summary; time_window, resolution_level)`

   * Preconditions:

     * `flow_state_summary` encodes coherent energy and gradient observables at the specified resolution over the time window.

2. ComponentName: `FlowRegularityDescriptor`

   * Type: field

   * Interface:

     * Inputs: `flow_state_summary`
     * Output: finite dimensional feature vector capturing regularity indicators and potential singular signatures derived from `DeltaS_energy` and `DeltaS_grad`.

   * Preconditions:

     * the summary reflects a three dimensional incompressible flow with well defined energy and gradient statistics.

3. ComponentName: `BlowUp_vs_Smooth_World_Template`

   * Type: experiment_pattern

   * Interface:

     * Inputs: `PDE_model_class`
     * Output: a pair of experiment designs for

       * a smooth world scenario,
       * a blow up world scenario,

       each with explicit NS style tension evaluation and falsification conditions.

   * Preconditions:

     * the model class allows extraction of energy like and gradient like observables at multiple resolutions.

### 8.2 Direct reuse targets

1. Q039 (BH_PHYS_QTURBULENCE_L3_039)

   * Reused component: `NS_Tension_3D`, `FlowRegularityDescriptor`.
   * Why it transfers: turbulence analysis relies on the interplay between energy cascades, gradients, and possible singular behavior, which fits directly into NS tension structures.
   * What changes: focus shifts from global regularity to statistical properties of turbulent regimes, while the observables and tension functional remain usable.

2. Q091 (BH_EARTH_CLIMATE_SENS_L3_091)

   * Reused component: `BlowUp_vs_Smooth_World_Template`.
   * Why it transfers: large scale climate models involve NS based dynamics, and extreme scenarios can be framed as smooth world versus blow up world analogs with coarse grained tension.
   * What changes: observables describe climate relevant flows and energy balances rather than idealized NS flows on simple domains.

3. Q040 (BH_PHYS_QBLACKHOLE_INFO_L3_040)

   * Reused component: `BlowUp_vs_Smooth_World_Template`.
   * Why it transfers: gravitational collapse and horizon formation can be mapped to blow up versus controlled evolution scenarios where tension indicators track the approach to singular structures.
   * What changes: the underlying fields and equations are gravitational, but the experiment pattern for contrasting smooth and singular behaviors remains structurally similar.

## 9. TU roadmap and verification levels

This block explains the current verification levels for Q011 and the next measurable steps.

### 9.1 Current levels

* E_level: E1

  * A coherent effective encoding of NS existence and smoothness in terms of consistency_tension has been specified.
  * At least two explicit experiments with falsification conditions have been described to test NS tension encodings.

* N_level: N1

  * The narrative linking local NS laws, global regularity, and NS tension has been made explicit at the effective layer.
  * Counterfactual worlds S and B have been outlined in terms of observable summaries and tension profiles.

### 9.2 Next measurable step toward E2

To move from E1 to E2, the following steps are proposed.

1. Fix a concrete finite library `Lib_energy_Q011` and `Lib_grad_Q011` with explicit, published definitions of the reference profiles and their justification from known NS results.
2. Specify at least one concrete refinement scheme `refine*(k)` and implement it in a working prototype that computes NS tension values from numerical NS data.
3. Run at least one of the experiments in Section 6 on real numerical data or toy model families, and release the resulting NS tension profiles as open data suitable for external audit.

These steps can be carried out entirely at the effective layer and do not require exposing any deep TU generative rules.

### 9.3 Long term role in the TU program

In the long term Q011 is expected to serve as

* the reference node for tension based analysis of evolution equations and regularity problems,
* a template for encoding blow up versus global regularity scenarios in other domains,
* a bridge between pure PDE analysis, turbulence theory, and complex systems where finite time singular behavior is a central concern.

## 10. Elementary but precise explanation

The Navier–Stokes equations in three dimensions describe how a viscous fluid moves under the combined effects of inertia, pressure, and viscosity. They take a velocity field that satisfies the incompressibility condition `div u = 0` and prescribe how it changes over time.

The open problem asks two precise questions.

* If you start with a smooth, finite energy initial flow, does the equation always produce a smooth flow for all future times?
* Or is it possible for the flow to develop a genuine singularity, such as infinite velocity or gradients, in a finite amount of time?

In the Tension Universe view, this file does not try to prove or disprove any of these possibilities. Instead it introduces a way to measure how “tense” a flow is with respect to known smoothness compatible behavior.

The construction proceeds in three steps.

1. We imagine a space of states where each state is a summary of how a flow behaves over some time interval and resolution.

   * how much kinetic energy it has,
   * how strong the vorticity is,
   * how large the velocity gradients become.

2. We compare these summaries to reference profiles that are built only from known theorems about NS, such as energy inequalities and partial regularity results.

   * If the summaries fit inside these profiles, mismatch is small.
   * If they deviate strongly, mismatch is large.

3. We combine the mismatches into a single NS tension value.

   * Low NS tension means the encoded behavior is compatible with the smoothness friendly reference bounds.
   * High NS tension means the encoded behavior looks closer to patterns that would accompany blow up or at least violate those bounds.

We then describe two hypothetical kinds of worlds.

* In a smooth world, as we look at the flow at finer and finer resolutions, the NS tension can be kept within controlled bounds that are compatible with known smoothness criteria.
* In a blow up world, for some flows the NS tension eventually becomes persistently large at certain scales and cannot be made small without breaking faith with the actual behavior.

This does not solve the Navier–Stokes problem and does not construct any solutions. It provides

* a precise effective layer language for talking about NS existence and smoothness in terms of observable summaries and tension values,
* experiments that can falsify or support specific encodings,
* tools that AI systems can use to reason about NS without accidentally claiming to have settled the Millennium Problem.

Q011 is therefore the main NS node in the Tension Universe. It encodes how global regularity for fluid flows appears as a question of low tension versus high tension at the effective layer, while leaving the underlying open problem untouched.

## Tension Universe effective layer footer

This page is part of the WFGY / Tension Universe S-problem collection.

### Scope of claims

* The goal of this document is to specify an effective layer encoding of the Navier–Stokes existence and smoothness problem.
* It does not claim to prove or disprove the canonical statement in Section 1.
* It does not introduce any new theorem beyond what is already established in the cited literature.
* It should not be cited as evidence that the corresponding open problem has been solved.

### Effective layer boundary

* All objects used here (state space `M`, observables, invariants, tension scores, counterfactual worlds) live at the effective layer of the TU framework.
* No assumptions are made about any particular deep layer generative rule or physical ontology.
* No explicit mapping from raw mathematical or physical data into TU internal fields is given in this document.

### Encoding fairness and non mutation

* All encoding choices for this problem (libraries, weight sets, refinement schemes, thresholds) are selected from finite families defined at the charter level and are identified by the precommit keys recorded in Section 3.1.
* Once an encoding key for this file is published, its associated choices are frozen for this version of Q011 and must not be altered in response to experimental outcomes.
* If later work changes any of these choices, the change must appear as a new encoding key and a new version of this file, not as a silent mutation of the present version.

### Falsifiability

* Experiments in Section 6 can falsify the current Q011 encoding at the effective layer if their stated failure conditions are met.
* Falsifying this encoding means that this particular combination of state representation, observables, reference libraries, and tension functionals is rejected for use in TU. It does not mean that the Navier–Stokes existence and smoothness problem itself is resolved in either direction.

### Charter references

The formal rules that govern effective layer encodings are defined in the following TU charters.

* [TU Effective Layer Charter](../Charters/TU_EFFECTIVE_LAYER_CHARTER.md)

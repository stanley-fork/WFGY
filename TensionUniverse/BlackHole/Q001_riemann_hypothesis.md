## 0. Effective layer disclaimer

All content in this file lives at the **effective layer** of the Tension Universe (TU) framework.

* We only talk about **state spaces, observables, invariants, tension scores and counterfactual worlds** as engineering level objects.
* We do not specify any TU base axiom system, any deep generative rule, or any constructive mapping from raw arithmetic data to internal TU fields.
* Nothing in this file claims to **prove** or **disprove** the classical Riemann Hypothesis.

Semantics choice for this problem:

* The tag `Semantics: continuous` in the header means that both the spectral side and the arithmetic side are encoded as **finite dimensional real feature vectors**.
* Histograms of zeros and summaries of prime errors are treated as continuous observables, up to a fixed choice of norm and scaling.
* This semantics choice is fixed for all blocks that mention `DeltaS_spec`, `DeltaS_arith`, `Tension_RH` or the effective tension tensor.

Counterfactual worlds:

* When we speak about **World T** and **World F** later in this file, they are **counterfactual tension patterns** over the same family of observables under a frozen encoding tuple.
* They are not claims about which world we actually live in.
* They are not hidden encodings of the canonical answer to RH.

Scope of claims:

* This file only specifies an **effective encoding** of RH as a spectral tension problem.
* It is designed so that encodings and procedures can be **falsified** or retired without touching the canonical statement.
* The global rules that constrain effective layer behavior, encoding fairness and tension scales are written in the shared TU charters and not repeated here in full.

All later references to "Block 0" or to the semantics choice in this problem refer back to this section.

## 1. Canonical problem and status

### 1.1 Canonical statement

Let zeta(s) be the Riemann zeta function, initially defined for complex s with real part greater than 1 by the convergent series

```txt
zeta(s) = sum_{n=1 to infinity} 1 / n^s
```

and extended to a meromorphic function on the complex plane with a single simple pole at `s = 1`.

The nontrivial zeros of zeta(s) are the zeros in the critical strip, meaning those zeros with real part strictly between 0 and 1.

The Riemann Hypothesis (RH) is the statement:

> Every nontrivial zero of zeta(s) has real part exactly `1/2`.

Equivalently, if `zeta(s) = 0` and the real part of s is strictly between 0 and 1, then `Re(s) = 1/2`.

This is a central open problem of analytic number theory and of modern mathematics as a whole.

### 1.2 Status and difficulty

RH has remained open since Riemann's 1859 memoir. Partial results include:

* All nontrivial zeros lie in the critical strip `0 < Re(s) < 1` by analytic continuation and the functional equation.
* Infinitely many zeros lie on the critical line `Re(s) = 1/2`.
* A positive proportion of zeros are known to lie on the critical line.
* Many deep theorems in prime number theory, in particular about error terms in the prime number theorem and related counting functions, are equivalent to, or would follow from, RH.

No proof or disproof is known. The problem is widely believed to be extremely difficult and is one of the Clay Mathematics Institute Millennium Prize Problems.

### 1.3 Role in the BlackHole project

Within the BlackHole S problem collection, Q001 plays three roles:

1. It is the root example of a spectral_tension problem, where analytic spectral data and arithmetic structure must cohere.
2. It anchors the family of L function and number theoretic spectral problems (Q002, Q003, Q015, Q018, Q019).
3. It provides a clean setting to test the Tension Universe encoding of:

   * spectral fields,
   * arithmetic observables,
   * tension functionals and counterfactual worlds.

## 2. Position in the BlackHole graph

This block records how Q001 sits inside the BlackHole graph as nodes and edges among Q001–Q125. Each edge is listed with a one line reason that points to a concrete component or tension type.

### 2.1 Upstream problems

These problems provide prerequisites, tools, or general foundations that Q001 relies on at the effective layer.

* Q016 (BH_MATH_ZFC_CH_L3_016)

Cross domain edges connect Q001 to problems in other domains that can reuse its components.

* Q032 (BH_PHYS_QTHERMO_L3_032)
  Reason: Can reuse tension style functionals on spectra to relate microscopic energy distributions to macroscopic thermodynamic behavior.

* Q040 (BH_PHYS_QBLACKHOLE_INFO_L3_040)
  Reason: Can reuse spectral_tension tools to study how field spectra encode information in black hole models.

* Q059 (BH_CS_INFO_THERMODYN_L3_059)
  Reason: Reuses the notion of tension between spectral structure and information theoretic observables.

* Q123 (BH_AI_INTERP_L3_123)
  Reason: Uses RH spectral_tension encoding as a model for interpreting internal AI representations as structured spectra.

## 3. Tension Universe encoding (effective layer)

All content in this block is at the effective layer and respects the semantics choice in Block 0. We only describe:

* state spaces,
* observables and fields,
* invariants and tension scores,
* singular sets and domain restrictions.

We do not describe any hidden generative rules or construction of internal TU fields from raw data.

### 3.1 State space and minimal structure lock

We assume the existence of a semantic state space

```txt
M
```

with the following interpretation at the effective layer:

* Each element `m` in `M` represents a coherent "zeta world configuration" for the Riemann zeta function, consisting of:

  * local spectral data for zeta(s) in a bounded region of the critical strip,
  * local arithmetic data related to primes or prime powers in corresponding ranges,
  * coarse meta information about the regularity of the spectral data.

We do not specify how these configurations are constructed from raw numerical computations or proofs.

We assume the following minimal structure, just enough to make suprema, refinement and audits meaningful:

* `M` is a set of states.
* `Par` is a subset of `R^k` for some finite k, containing resolution parameters used by the encoding. Typical elements of `Par` are written `r`, with a countable resolution ladder `r_k` defined in Block 3.4.
* Every observable defined in this file is a well defined map on a restricted domain `M_reg` defined in Block 3.5.
* Any sup over a family of regions is always taken over a countable family parameterized by an explicit resolution index. No uncountable families are used for suprema.

For later experiments we also make the following effective data interface explicit, without exposing any deep TU generative rule:

* A state `m_k` at resolution `r_k` can be represented externally as a serializable object

  ```txt
  m_k = {
    resolution_id: r_k,
    region_id → zero_features,
    interval_id → arith_features,
    metadata
  }
  ```

  where `zero_features` and `arith_features` are finite dimensional vectors defined below. This is an engineering interface, not an ontological claim.

### 3.2 Effective fields, observables, and admissible encoding class

We next define the observables and the admissible encoding class that together determine the RH tension. All observables below are defined on `M_reg`.

For notational compactness, inputs will be written in combined form, for example `m_R` for a state plus a region.

#### 3.2.1 Local spectral density observable

```txt
rho_zero(m_R) >= 0
```

* Input: `m_R` denotes a state `m` paired with a bounded region `R` in the critical strip, where `R` is one element of a deterministic, countable family.
* Output: a scalar or short feature vector summarizing the density and low order statistics of nontrivial zeros in `R` as encoded in `m`.

For each region `R` with imaginary part range `[T, T + ΔT]`, the encoding uses a fixed binning scheme:

* divide `[T, T + ΔT]` into `N_spec` equal subintervals,
* count zeros in each bin,
* optionally normalize by `ΔT` to obtain a density histogram.

Whenever we speak of norms we use an L2 norm on this fixed finite dimensional representation.

#### 3.2.2 Local arithmetic profile observable

```txt
A_prime(m_I)
```

* Input: `m_I` denotes a state `m` paired with an interval `I = [X, Y]` of positive real numbers chosen from a deterministic, countable family coupled to regions.
* Output: a finite dimensional vector summarizing prime distribution features on `I`, for example:

  * the values of `π_m(x_j) − li(x_j)` at a frozen set of anchor points `{x_j}` inside `I`,
  * discrete differences of these errors between consecutive anchors.

Finite value lock:

* For all `m` in `M_reg` and admissible `I`, `A_prime(m_I)` is finite by definition of `M_reg`.

The anchor sets `{x_j}` are determined by a fixed rule:

* given an interval `I = [X, Y]` and resolution parameter `r`, define a finite set `Anchors(I, r)` by a declared grid rule (for example geometric spacing between `X` and `Y`);
* this rule is part of the encoding spec and is identical for all experiments within a given encoding tuple.

#### 3.2.3 Spectral mismatch observable with explicit metric

```txt
DeltaS_spec(m_R) >= 0
```

Interpretation: L2 deviation of the encoded spectral histogram from a frozen reference profile.

Let

* `h(m_R)` be the `N_spec` dimensional histogram derived from `rho_zero(m_R)` under the fixed binning scheme,
* `h_ref(R, r)` be the reference histogram for region `R` at resolution `r`, as explained in the reference class definition below.

Then we define

```txt
DeltaS_spec(m_R) = sqrt( sum_j ( h_j(m_R) - h_ref_j(R, r) )^2 )
```

Properties:

* `DeltaS_spec(m_R) >= 0`.
* `DeltaS_spec(m_R) = 0` if and only if `h(m_R)` agrees with `h_ref(R, r)` exactly, within the declared numerical tolerance for that resolution.

#### 3.2.4 Arithmetic mismatch observable with explicit metric

```txt
DeltaS_arith(m_I) >= 0
```

Interpretation: L2 deviation of prime summary features from a frozen reference profile.

Let

* `a(m_I)` be the feature vector derived from `A_prime(m_I)` on the anchor set `Anchors(I, r)`,
* `a_ref(I, r)` be the reference arithmetic feature vector on the same anchors.

Then we define

```txt
DeltaS_arith(m_I) = sqrt( sum_j ( a_j(m_I) - a_ref_j(I, r) )^2 )
```

Properties:

* `DeltaS_arith(m_I) >= 0`.
* `DeltaS_arith(m_I) = 0` if and only if `a(m_I)` agrees with `a_ref(I, r)` within the declared tolerance model.

#### 3.2.5 Coupling rule between regions and intervals

To relate spectral and arithmetic data, we fix a deterministic coupling between regions `R` and intervals `I`.

Let a vertical region be specified as

```txt
R(T) = { s : Re(s) in [0, 1], Im(s) in [T, T + ΔT] }
```

for some `T` on a declared grid and a fixed height `ΔT > 0` that does not vary between experiments.

The coupled interval is

```txt
I(T) = [exp(T), exp(T + ΔT)]
```

All evaluations of `DeltaS_spec(m_R)` and `DeltaS_arith(m_I)` used to form RH tension must use pairs `(R(T), I(T))` obtained from this coupling rule, together with the pre declared resolution ladder `r_k` and anchor rules.

This removes any free choice to adjust intervals after looking at data.

#### 3.2.6 Combined RH mismatch and weight lock

We define the combined RH mismatch for a state `m` at a chosen pair `(R, I)` as

```txt
DeltaS_RH(m) = w_spec * DeltaS_spec(m_R) + w_arith * DeltaS_arith(m_I)
```

Weight lock (anti cheat and auditability):

* `w_spec + w_arith = 1`.
* `w_spec` and `w_arith` are fixed before any experiment runs.
* `w_spec` is in `[0.2, 0.8]` and `w_arith` is in `[0.2, 0.8]`.

To keep the encoding class finite:

* The allowed values of `w_spec` and `w_arith` are taken from a **finite discrete set** of pairs specified at the charter level, for example a small list of rational pairs that satisfy the above bounds.
* Once an encoding tuple chooses one such pair, it cannot vary inside this problem.

Any change to weights after seeing evaluation outputs invalidates the experiment as "not admissible" for this encoding class.

#### 3.2.7 Admissible encoding class Enc_RH

To prevent "choose reference so tension is always small" exploits, we define an admissible encoding class `Enc_RH` that locks references, weights and couplings.

**Finite encoding class**

The admissible class for this problem is a **finite set** of encoding tuples

```txt
Enc_RH = { Enc_RH^1, Enc_RH^2, ..., Enc_RH^J }
```

where each tuple has the form

```txt
Enc = (Ref_spec, Ref_arith, w_spec, w_arith, alpha, beta, CouplingRule, LadderSpec, ToleranceModel)
```

and every component is chosen from a finite option list defined at the charter level. In particular:

* reference libraries are finite,
* allowed weight pairs `(w_spec, w_arith)` form a finite discrete set,
* allowed coefficient pairs `(alpha, beta)` form a finite discrete set,
* allowed ladder profiles and tolerance profiles form finite lists.

This makes the universal quantifier "for any Enc in Enc_RH" auditable.

Admissible reference class for spectral data:

* `Ref_spec` is selected from a finite library built only from:

  * closed form baseline densities and envelopes implied by the standard analytic framework of zeta(s), such as Riemann–von Mangoldt type formulas,
  * and optional random matrix inspired reference ensembles specified in advance.

* `Ref_spec` may depend on `(R, r)` where `r` is a resolution parameter from `Par`.

* `Ref_spec` is not allowed to depend on the actual evaluation dataset values of zero positions in a way that is fitted after inspection.

Admissible reference class for arithmetic data:

* `Ref_arith` is selected from a finite library built only from:

  * baseline prime distribution approximations and envelopes consistent with standard analytic number theory,
  * and explicit bounds or benchmark envelopes defined independently of the evaluation dataset.

* `Ref_arith` may depend on `(I, r)`.

* `Ref_arith` cannot be chosen or tuned after seeing evaluation results.

Weight and coefficient lock:

* The constraints on `w_spec` and `w_arith` described above hold for all `Enc` in `Enc_RH`.

* The coefficients `alpha` and `beta` used in the tension functional (see Block 4.1) satisfy:

  ```txt
  alpha + beta = 1
  alpha in [0.2, 0.8]
  beta in [0.2, 0.8]
  ```

* `(alpha, beta)` are taken from a finite discrete set of pairs specified at the charter level.

* `(alpha, beta)` are frozen together with `(w_spec, w_arith)` for each encoding tuple.

Coupling and ladder lock:

* `CouplingRule` is the fixed mapping `R(T) -> I(T)` from Block 3.2.5.
* `LadderSpec` defines a countable resolution ladder `r_k` and associated region families, as described in Block 3.4.
* Both are fixed before any evaluation and each admissible choice is listed in a finite charter level menu.

Tolerance model:

* `ToleranceModel` gathers all explicit numerical tolerances, including:

  * acceptable histogram error margins for `DeltaS_spec`,
  * acceptable arithmetic feature error margins for `DeltaS_arith`,
  * and the rules by which epsilon and delta thresholds are later derived.

* Each `ToleranceModel` used here is chosen from a finite charter level library.

Fairness and audit constraint:

* For each encoding tuple in `Enc_RH`:

  * the reference choices, weights, coefficients, coupling rule, ladder and tolerance model are declared in full,
  * a cryptographic hash of the full encoding spec text is published before any experiment in Block 6 is run.

Any adaptation of references, weights, coefficients or coupling after seeing outcomes is considered a failure of the encoding procedure, not evidence about RH.

### 3.3 Effective tension tensor components

We assume an effective semantic tension tensor `T_ij` over `M`, consistent with the TU core decision:

```txt
T_ij(m) = S_i(m) * C_j(m) * DeltaS_RH(m) * lambda(m) * kappa
```

where:

* `S_i(m)` is a source like factor representing the strength of the i th semantic source component in `m`.
* `C_j(m)` is a receptivity like factor representing how sensitive the j th downstream component is to RH related mismatches.
* `DeltaS_RH(m)` is the combined mismatch defined above under the locked admissible class.
* `lambda(m)` is a convergence state factor taking values in a fixed range encoding convergent versus divergent behavior states.
* `kappa` is a coupling constant setting the overall scale of RH related spectral tension.

The exact indexing sets for `i` and `j` are not needed at the effective layer. It is sufficient that for each `m` in `M_reg`, `T_ij(m)` is well defined and finite.

### 3.4 Invariants and scale locked constraints

We define effective invariants using only countable, scale locked region families. This prevents thin region exploits.

Resolution ladder and admissible region families:

* Choose a countable resolution ladder `r_k` in `Par`, indexed by `k = 1, 2, 3, ...`.
* For each `r_k`, define a countable family of admissible regions `Regions(r_k)` by a deterministic rule.
* Any sup over regions is always taken over `Regions(r_k)` for some declared `k`.

1. Critical line invariance (scale locked)

Let `Regions_line(r_k)` be the admissible family of vertical regions at scale `r_k` that approximate the critical line, constructed by a fixed rule, for example:

* boxes with width covering `Re(s) in [0, 1]`,
* height `ΔT` fixed by `r_k`,
* imaginary parts on a pre declared grid.

Define

```txt
I_line_k(m) = sup_{R in Regions_line(r_k)} DeltaS_spec(m_R)
I_line(m)   = sup_k I_line_k(m)
```

All `Regions_line(r_k)` must be explicitly specified by a deterministic rule. The countability and determinism make the sup externally auditable.

2. Spectral statistics invariance (scale locked)

Let `Regions_stats(r_k)` be another deterministic family of regions at scale `r_k`. Let `stat_zero` be a fixed statistic extractor operating on the histograms used for `DeltaS_spec`, and let

```txt
stat_ref(R, r_k)
```

be derived from the chosen `Ref_spec` without using evaluation data.

Define

```txt
I_stats_k(m) = sup_{R in Regions_stats(r_k)}
               | stat_zero(m_R) - stat_ref(R, r_k) |
I_stats(m)    = sup_k I_stats_k(m)
```

This provides a multi scale invariant for spectral statistics.

### 3.5 Singular set and domain restrictions

Some observables may be undefined or not finite if encoded data are incomplete or inconsistent. To handle this, define a singular set `S_sing` by an explicit domain rule:

```txt
S_sing is a subset of M
m is in S_sing if DeltaS_RH(m) is undefined or not finite
```

We impose:

* All RH related tension analysis is restricted to `M_reg`, where `M_reg` is the set of states `m` in `M` that are not in `S_sing`.
* If an experiment attempts to evaluate `DeltaS_RH` on a state outside `M_reg`, the outcome is "out of domain" and must not be interpreted as evidence about RH.

---

## 4. Tension principle for this problem

This block states how Q001 is characterized as a tension problem within TU at the effective layer, with refinement and encoding class locks.

### 4.1 Core tension functional and coefficient lock

We define an effective RH tension functional:

```txt
Tension_RH(m) = F(DeltaS_spec(m_R), DeltaS_arith(m_I))
```

where `F` is a fixed nonnegative function, for example

```txt
Tension_RH(m) = alpha * DeltaS_spec(m_R) + beta * DeltaS_arith(m_I)
```

with `alpha > 0` and `beta > 0`.

Coefficient lock:

* `alpha + beta = 1`.
* `alpha` and `beta` lie in `[0.2, 0.8]`.
* `alpha` and `beta` belong to a finite discrete set specified at the charter level.
* `alpha` and `beta` are part of each encoding tuple `Enc` in `Enc_RH`, frozen and audited together with references and weights.

### 4.2 RH as a low tension principle (refinement order locked)

At the effective layer, RH is expressed as a low tension consistency claim under an admissible encoding.

Refinement order lock:

* The resolution ladder `r_k` is fixed as in Block 3.4.
* For each `k`, let `m_k` be a state in `M_reg` representing the world at resolution `r_k` under the same frozen encoding tuple `Enc` in `Enc_RH`.
* The sequence `(m_k)` is the only object on which refinement statements are made in this file.

Low tension formulation:

> In RH true worlds, for any fixed admissible encoding tuple `Enc` in `Enc_RH`, there exist world representing sequences `(m_k)` such that `Tension_RH(m_k)` stays bounded in a narrow band across `k`.

Formally at the effective layer, for some index `k0(Enc)`,

```txt
sup_{k >= k0} Tension_RH(m_k) <= epsilon_RH(Enc)
```

where `epsilon_RH(Enc)` is a declared threshold tied to the tolerance model in `Enc` and derived as described in Block 6.3. It is chosen before evaluation and does not grow unbounded as resolution increases.

### 4.3 RH failure as persistent high tension (encoding class locked)

If RH is false, the "persistent high tension" statement is only meaningful relative to `Enc_RH`.

High tension formulation:

> In RH false worlds, for any fixed admissible encoding tuple `Enc` in `Enc_RH`, any world representing sequence `(m_k)` eventually has tension bounded away from zero.

Effective layer statement using the refinement ladder:

There exists a strictly positive constant `delta_RH(Enc)` such that, for each fixed encoding tuple `Enc` in `Enc_RH`, there exists `k0(Enc)` with

```txt
inf_{k >= k0} Tension_RH(m_k) >= delta_RH(Enc)
```

The value `delta_RH(Enc)` is derived from mock world experiments as described in Block 6.3 and is part of the frozen encoding tuple.

This prevents exploits where one keeps modifying references or weights to drive tension to zero, because:

* reference choices are restricted and frozen,
* weights and coefficients are locked and audited,
* region families and coupling rules are deterministic,
* the encoding class itself is finite and fully enumerated.

Thus, at the effective layer, Q001 states that the universe belongs to a low tension spectral world rather than to a high tension one, for some `Enc` in `Enc_RH`.

---

## 5. Counterfactual tension worlds

We outline two counterfactual worlds, described strictly at the effective layer and always relative to a fixed `Enc` in `Enc_RH`:

* World T: RH is true.
* World F: RH is false.

Each world is described through observable tension patterns. No hidden construction rules are provided and no canonical answer is stored inside any encoding parameter.

### 5.1 World T (RH true, low spectral tension)

In World T, for any fixed encoding tuple `Enc` in `Enc_RH`:

1. Critical line behavior

   For world representing sequences `(m_k)` on the declared resolution ladder, `I_line(m_k)` remains small and stable across `k`.

2. Spectral statistics

   `I_stats(m_k)` matches, within the tolerance model in `Enc`, the frozen `stat_ref` baselines derived from `Ref_spec`.

3. Arithmetic profiles

   `DeltaS_arith(m_I)` stays within the tolerance model tied to `Ref_arith` across the declared coupled intervals `I(T)`.

4. Global tension

   There exists `k0` such that

   ```txt
   sup_{k >= k0} Tension_RH(m_k) <= epsilon_RH(Enc)
   ```

### 5.2 World F (RH false, high spectral tension)

In World F, for any fixed encoding tuple `Enc` in `Enc_RH`:

1. Critical line deviation

   For any world representing sequence `(m_k)`, the scale locked invariant cannot stay arbitrarily small. There exists `k0` such that `I_line(m_k)` is bounded away from zero for `k >= k0`.

2. Spectral statistics anomaly

   `I_stats(m_k)` eventually deviates from `stat_ref` in a way that does not shrink under increasing `k`.

3. Arithmetic distortion

   There exist coupled intervals `I(T)` where `DeltaS_arith(m_I)` violates the tolerance envelope tied to `Ref_arith` in `Enc`.

4. Global tension

   There exists `k0` such that

   ```txt
   inf_{k >= k0} Tension_RH(m_k) >= delta_RH(Enc)
   ```

   where `delta_RH(Enc) > 0` is the class level lower bound.

### 5.3 Interpretive note

These counterfactual worlds do not claim to construct TU internal fields from raw data. They only assert that if faithful world representing sequences exist under a locked encoding tuple, then the observable tension patterns differ as described.

They are templates for how RH true versus RH false worlds would look under this effective layer encoding, not storage locations for the canonical answer.

---

## 6. Falsifiability, discriminating experiments, and threshold calibration

This block specifies experiments and protocols at the effective layer that can:

* test the coherence of the Q001 encoding,
* discriminate between alternative admissible encoding tuples,
* falsify specific TU encodings for Q001,
* and define the thresholds `epsilon_RH(Enc)` and `delta_RH(Enc)`.

These experiments do not prove or disprove RH. They test encoding procedures and encoding tuples.

### 6.1 Experiment 1: Numerical spectral tension profile (pre registered encoding)

**Scope of this experiment**

This experiment tests a frozen TU encoding tuple `Enc` for Q001 and the associated procedure. It does not test the canonical truth of the Riemann Hypothesis.

Goal:

* Test whether the frozen `Tension_RH` functional and reference classes produce stable, non cheat friendly tension profiles on published numerical datasets.

Setup:

* Input data: published tables of nontrivial zeros of zeta(s) up to a stated height range, and associated prime counting summaries over coupled ranges.

* Declare:

  * the resolution ladder `r_k`, region families `Regions(r_k)`, `Regions_line(r_k)`, and `Regions_stats(r_k)`,
  * the coupling rule `R(T) -> I(T)` with fixed `ΔT`,
  * the anchor rules `Anchors(I, r_k)`.

* Freeze a specific encoding tuple `Enc` in `Enc_RH`:

  * select `Ref_spec` from the admissible spectral library,
  * select `Ref_arith` from the admissible arithmetic library,
  * fix `w_spec`, `w_arith`, `alpha`, `beta` within locked discrete choices,
  * fix `ToleranceModel` chosen from the finite charter level library,
  * publish a hash of the full encoding spec before evaluation.

Protocol:

1. For each `k` in a declared range, construct states `m_k` in `M_reg` that represent the world at scale `r_k`, using the published zero and prime data as inputs to the engineering interface in Block 3.1.
2. For each coupled pair `(R(T), I(T))` at this scale, compute `DeltaS_spec(m_R)` and `DeltaS_arith(m_I)` using the frozen references and metrics.
3. Compute `Tension_RH(m_k)` for each `k`.
4. Compute `I_line_k(m_k)` and `I_stats_k(m_k)` using the deterministic region families.
5. Report all results together with the full encoding tuple and its hash.

Metrics:

* The sequence `Tension_RH(m_k)` across `k`.
* The sequences `I_line_k(m_k)` and `I_stats_k(m_k)` across `k`.
* Sensitivity under small, pre registered perturbations inside the admissible ranges defined at the charter level.

Falsification conditions:

* If, under the frozen admissible encoding tuple, `Tension_RH(m_k)` is unstable in the sense that it has uncontrolled jumps across adjacent `k` that cannot be attributed to declared tolerance or resolution effects, the encoding tuple is rejected as not robust.
* If post hoc adjustments to `Ref_spec`, `Ref_arith` or weights are required to obtain reasonable tension bands, the encoding procedure is rejected as not admissible for Q001.
* If the encoding yields materially different qualitative conclusions under small, pre registered parameter changes inside the allowed discrete sets, it is rejected as non auditable.

Semantics note:

* All calculations follow the semantics choice in Block 0.
* The operator interpretations used by `DeltaS_spec` and `DeltaS_arith` remain unchanged across `k`.

Boundary note:

* Falsifying a TU encoding in this experiment is not the same as solving the canonical statement.

### 6.2 Experiment 2: Model world comparison with mock zeta like functions (class separation)

**Scope of this experiment**

This experiment tests whether a frozen TU encoding tuple `Enc` for Q001 can separate RH like and non RH like families. It does not test the canonical truth of RH.

Goal:

* Test whether the frozen Q001 encoding can separate RH like versus non RH like spectral families under the same admissible encoding class, without tuning after seeing outcomes.

Setup:

* Construct or select zeta like families:

  * Family T: functions with zeros constrained to a single vertical line by construction, mimicking RH behavior.
  * Family F: functions with a declared fraction of zeros off that line by construction.

* For each function, generate synthetic spectral and arithmetic like summaries to populate states `m_k` on the resolution ladder.

* Freeze the same encoding tuple `Enc` in `Enc_RH` as in Experiment 1.

Protocol:

1. For each family element and each `k`, build a state `m_k` in `M_reg` representing that model at scale `r_k`.
2. Compute `DeltaS_spec`, `DeltaS_arith` and `Tension_RH` for all such `m_k` using frozen references and weights.
3. Compare the tension distributions between Family T and Family F across `k`.

Metrics:

* Mean and variance of `Tension_RH` for Family T and Family F.
* Separation between the two distributions at each `k`.
* Stability of the separation across `k`.
* Agreement between separation and the known construction labels T versus F.

Falsification conditions:

* If the encoding fails to separate Family T from Family F across `k` for the frozen tuple, the encoding is rejected as misaligned for Q001.
* If the encoding systematically assigns lower tension to Family F than Family T under the frozen tuple, the encoding is rejected as directionally incorrect.

Semantics note:

* All calculations follow the semantics choice in Block 0.
* The same deterministic `Regions(r_k)` and coupling rule must be used.

Boundary note:

* Falsifying a TU encoding in this experiment is not the same as solving the canonical statement.

### 6.3 Calibration of epsilon_RH(Enc) and delta_RH(Enc)

The thresholds `epsilon_RH(Enc)` and `delta_RH(Enc)` used in Block 4 are derived from Experiment 2 and are part of the frozen encoding tuple.

Calibration rule:

* For each encoding tuple `Enc`:

  1. Run Experiment 2 on Family T and Family F.
  2. Let `Tension_RH_T(k)` and `Tension_RH_F(k)` denote the distributions on each family at scale `k`.

* Define `epsilon_RH(Enc)` as:

  * a fixed quantile (for example the 95th percentile) of the pooled `Tension_RH_T(k)` values across all `k` in a pre declared range, rounded up according to the tolerance model.

* Define `delta_RH(Enc)` as:

  * a fixed quantile (for example the 5th percentile) of the pooled `Tension_RH_F(k)` values across the same range, rounded down according to the tolerance model.

Constraints:

* The quantile choices and ranges are specified in `ToleranceModel` before any experiments.
* The allowed quantile choices and rounding rules must stay inside the global constraints in the TU Tension Scale Charter.
* Once chosen, `epsilon_RH(Enc)` and `delta_RH(Enc)` are frozen and published together with the encoding tuple.

This makes the thresholds themselves reproducible and prevents implicit tuning.

## 7. AI and WFGY engineering spec

This block describes how Q001 can be used as an engineering module for AI systems within the WFGY framework, at the effective layer.

### 7.1 Training signals

We define training signals that encourage RH aware and tension aware reasoning under the encoding.

1. `signal_zero_spectrum_stability`

   * Definition: a penalty proportional to `DeltaS_spec(m_R)` evaluated on the coupled `(m_R)` inputs across declared regions.
   * Purpose: discourage internal representations that imply spectral patterns inconsistent with the frozen reference baselines.

2. `signal_prime_error_profile`

   * Definition: a penalty derived from `DeltaS_arith(m_I)` evaluated on coupled `(m_I)` inputs across declared intervals.
   * Purpose: discourage internal representations that imply arithmetic profiles outside the frozen tolerance envelope.

3. `signal_spectral_tension_score`

   * Definition: the scalar `Tension_RH(m)` under the frozen admissible tuple.
   * Purpose: provide a single measurable indicator of RH consistency tension.

4. `signal_counterfactual_consistency`

   * Definition: a consistency penalty when the model mixes World T and World F assumptions in the same explanation under a declared stance prompt.
   * Purpose: enforce clean separation of counterfactual assumptions rather than blended narratives.

### 7.2 Architectural patterns

We outline module patterns that reuse Q001 structures without revealing any deep TU generative rules.

1. `SpectralTensionHead`

   * Role: produce an estimate of `Tension_RH` as an auxiliary output from internal representations.
   * Interface: internal embeddings to scalar tension estimate plus optional decomposed mismatch vector.

2. `ArithmeticConsistencyFilter`

   * Role: score candidate statements about primes for compatibility with frozen `Ref_arith` envelopes.
   * Interface: candidate statement representation to soft score or mask.

3. `TU_SpecField_Observer`

   * Role: extract simplified spectral summaries (rho_zero like descriptors) from internal representations.
   * Interface: internal embeddings to low dimensional spectral summary.

### 7.3 Evaluation harness

1. Task selection

   * Use analytic number theory prompts where RH strengthens bounds or sharpens error terms.

2. Conditions

   * Baseline: no explicit Q001 tension modules.
   * TU encoded: include `SpectralTensionHead` and `ArithmeticConsistencyFilter` driven by the frozen encoding tuple.

3. Metrics

   * Accuracy under RH assumed prompts.
   * Consistency across RH assumed versus RH denying prompts.
   * Stability of multi step reasoning without contradictions.

### 7.4 60 second reproduction protocol

Baseline setup:

* Prompt: explain links between zeta zeros, prime distribution, error terms and random matrix heuristics.
* Log: response text and any self reported uncertainty markers.

TU encoded setup:

* Prompt: same, plus require an explicit tension narrative that references `Tension_RH`, separates World T and World F and respects the encoding tuple.
* Log: response text plus any produced tension scores.

Comparison metric:

* Rate structural coherence, explicit linkage quality and counterfactual separation quality.

What to log:

* Prompts, outputs, encoding tuple hash and any auxiliary tension traces.

## 8. Cross problem transfer template

This block describes reusable components produced by Q001 and how they transfer.

### 8.1 Reusable components produced by this problem

1. ComponentName: `SpectralTensionScore_RH`

   * Type: functional

   * Minimal interface:

     * Inputs: `local_zero_summary`, `local_arith_summary`, `encoding_tuple_id`
     * Output: `tension_value` (nonnegative scalar)

   * Preconditions:

     * `encoding_tuple_id` points to a frozen admissible tuple in `Enc_RH`.
     * Summaries are generated by the deterministic region, interval and anchor rules.

2. ComponentName: `ZetaSpectrumField_Descriptor`

   * Type: field

   * Minimal interface:

     * Inputs: `region_id`, `resolution_id`

   * Preconditions:

     * `region_id` is in the deterministic `Regions(r_k)` family.
     * `resolution_id` matches `r_k` in `LadderSpec`.

3. ComponentName: `CounterfactualSpectralWorld_Template`

   * Type: experiment_pattern

   * Preconditions:

     * `encoding_tuple_id` is frozen and audited.
     * The model family provides spectral and arithmetic like summaries that can be mapped into the effective layer interface.

### 8.2 Direct reuse targets

1. Q002 (Generalized Riemann Hypothesis)

   * Reused component: `SpectralTensionScore_RH`, `ZetaSpectrumField_Descriptor`.
   * Why it transfers: the same spectral_tension form extends from zeta(s) to L function families.
   * What changes: local summaries are indexed by characters or family parameters.

2. Q003 (Birch and Swinnerton Dyer conjecture)

   * Reused component: `CounterfactualSpectralWorld_Template`.
   * Why it transfers: BSD links L function spectral behavior to arithmetic invariants, allowing similar World T versus World F patterns.
   * What changes: arithmetic summaries refer to elliptic curve invariants rather than primes.

3. Q018 (Pair correlation of zeros of zeta functions)

   * Reused component: `ZetaSpectrumField_Descriptor`.
   * Why it transfers: Q018 makes fine spectral statistics the primary observable.
   * What changes: higher order correlation features become mandatory outputs.

4. Q036 (High temperature superconductivity mechanism)

   * Reused component: `CounterfactualSpectralWorld_Template`.
   * Why it transfers: spectral_tension and counterfactual separation patterns apply to physical spectra.
   * What changes: model families are Hamiltonians; observables are energy level summaries.

## 9. TU roadmap and verification levels

This block positions Q001 on the TU verification ladder and declares next measurable steps.

### 9.1 Current levels

* E_level: E2

  * A coherent effective encoding of RH via spectral_tension is specified.
  * Experiments exist that can falsify an encoding tuple or procedure and calibrate thresholds.

* N_level: N2

  * The linkage between spectral and arithmetic observables is explicit at the effective layer.
  * Counterfactual worlds are specified in an auditable way using a fixed refinement ladder.

### 9.2 Next measurable step toward E3

To move from E2 to E3, implement at least one of the following in practice:

1. A public, reproducible prototype that, for a declared encoding tuple `Enc`:

   * computes `Tension_RH(m_k)`, `I_line_k(m_k)` and `I_stats_k(m_k)` on a declared `r_k` ladder using public zero and prime datasets,
   * publishes the full encoding tuple, deterministic region families, coupling rule, tolerance model and pre registration hash.

2. A public benchmark on mock zeta like families that demonstrates stable separation of Family T versus Family F under a frozen admissible encoding tuple, including:

   * published code and data for model families,
   * published tension distributions,
   * independent replication by external groups.

Both steps operate entirely at the effective layer because they work with observable summaries and audited encoding tuples, not with any deep TU generative rule.

### 9.3 Long term role in the TU program

Q001 is expected to serve as:

* The reference node for spectral_tension problems across mathematics and physics.
* A calibration ground for auditable tension encodings that avoid proof claims while still being testable.
* A bridge node connecting pure mathematics, mathematical physics and AI interpretability via shared spectral tension structure.

---

## 10. Elementary but precise explanation

The classical Riemann Hypothesis says:

> In the critical strip, all nontrivial zeros of zeta(s) line up on the line with real part equal to `1/2`.

Why it matters:

* The pattern of these zeros controls how primes fluctuate around their average distribution.
* If the zeros are well organized, prime fluctuations are constrained.

In the Tension Universe view, we do not claim a proof. Instead, we define an effective tension score:

* One part measures how far the observed zero statistics deviate from a frozen reference baseline.
* One part measures how far prime related summaries deviate from a frozen reference baseline.
* Both are combined into a single number `Tension_RH`.

The main anti cheat idea is that the reference baselines, weights, coefficients, coupling rule and resolution ladder are frozen before evaluation and audited. We do not allow a second pass where someone looks at results and then picks a new baseline that makes tension small.

Then we compare two kinds of world patterns:

* In a RH true world, there should exist a consistent sequence of descriptions at increasing resolution where `Tension_RH` stays in a small, stable band.
* In a RH false world, under the same frozen admissible encoding class, any consistent sequence eventually shows tension bounded away from zero.

This does not decide RH. It does something different and testable:

* It makes the RH world versus non RH world distinction auditable at the effective layer.
* It provides explicit observables and experiments that can falsify bad encodings.
* It defines reusable components for other spectral tension problems.

Q001 is therefore the prototype for spectral tension problems in the Tension Universe framework and a benchmark for encoding a world class open problem without crossing the boundary into deep generative rules.

## Tension Universe effective layer footer

This page is part of the **WFGY / Tension Universe** S problem collection.

### Scope of claims

* The goal of this document is to specify an **effective layer encoding** of the named problem.
* It does not claim to prove or disprove the canonical statement in Section 1.
* It does not introduce any new theorem beyond what is already established in the cited literature.
* It should not be cited as evidence that the corresponding open problem has been solved.

### Charter references

This page should be read together with the following charters:

* [TU Effective Layer Charter](../Charters/TU_EFFECTIVE_LAYER_CHARTER.md)
* [TU Encoding and Fairness Charter](../Charters/TU_ENCODING_AND_FAIRNESS_CHARTER.md)
* [TU Tension Scale Charter](../Charters/TU_TENSION_SCALE_CHARTER.md)
* [TU Global Guardrails](../Charters/TU_GLOBAL_GUARDRAILS.md)


### Effective layer boundary

* All objects used here (state spaces `M`, observables, invariants, tension scores, counterfactual "worlds") live at the effective layer.
* No step in this file gives a constructive mapping from raw experimental or simulation data into internal TU fields.
* No step exposes any deep TU generative rule or any first principle axiom system.

### Encoding and fairness

* Admissible encoding classes, reference profiles and weight families used in this page are constrained by the shared TU charters listed above.
* For every encoding class referenced here:

  * its definition, parameter ranges and reference families are fixed at the charter level before any problem specific tuning;
  * these choices may depend on general physical or mathematical considerations and on public benchmark selections, but not on the unknown truth value of this specific problem;
  * no encoding is allowed to hide the canonical answer as an uninterpreted field, label or parameter.

### Tension scale and thresholds

* All mismatch terms `DeltaS_*` and tension functionals in this file are treated as dimensionless or normalized quantities, defined up to a fixed monotone rescaling specified in the TU Tension Scale Charter.
* Thresholds such as `epsilon_*`, `delta_*` and experiment cutoffs are always interpreted relative to that fixed scale.
* Changing the tension scale requires an explicit update of the TU Tension Scale Charter, not an edit of individual problem files.

### Falsifiability and experiments

* Experiments described in this document are tests of TU encodings, not tests of the underlying canonical problem itself.
* The rule "falsifying a TU encoding is not the same as solving the canonical statement" applies globally, even where it is not restated.
* When required observables cannot be reliably estimated in practice, the outcome of the corresponding experiment is recorded as "inconclusive", not as confirmation.

### Interaction with established results

* All encodings and counterfactual worlds described here are required to respect known theorems and hard constraints in the relevant field.
* If a later analysis finds a concrete conflict with established results, the correct procedure is to update or retire the encoding under the TU charters, not to reinterpret those results.

### Versioning and non mutation policy

* This file is a versioned specification within the WFGY / Tension Universe research program.
* Definitions and symbols in this file are frozen for this version.
* Revisions, if needed, must be published as a new versioned file or accompanied by an explicit changelog entry and must not silently alter prior definitions.
* All changes to encoding classes, reference libraries, weight ranges or tolerance models that affect multiple problems should be made at the charter level, not by local edits to this file.

### Program note

* This page is an experimental specification within the ongoing WFGY / Tension Universe program.
* All structures and parameter choices are provisional and may be revised in future versions, subject to the constraints above.

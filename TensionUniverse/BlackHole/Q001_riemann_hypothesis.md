## 0. Effective layer disclaimer

All content in this file lives at the effective layer of the Tension Universe (TU) framework.

* We only talk about state spaces, observables, invariants, tension scores, and counterfactual worlds as engineering level objects.
* We do not specify any TU base axiom system, any deep generative rule, or any constructive mapping from raw arithmetic data to internal TU fields.
* Nothing in this file claims to prove or disprove the classical Riemann Hypothesis.

Semantics choice for this problem:

* The header tag `Semantics: finite_real_vector` means both the spectral side and the arithmetic side are represented as fixed finite dimensional real feature vectors.
* Histograms of zeros and summaries of prime errors are treated as normalized, dimensionless observables under a fixed, pre declared norm and scaling.
* This semantics choice is frozen for all blocks that mention `DeltaS_spec`, `DeltaS_arith`, `Mismatch_RH`, `Tension_RH`, or any effective tension tensor component.

Counterfactual worlds:

* When we speak about World T and World F later in this file, they are counterfactual tension patterns over the same family of observables under a frozen encoding tuple.
* They are not claims about which world we actually live in.
* They are not hidden encodings of the canonical answer to RH.

Scope of claims:

* This file specifies an effective encoding of RH as a spectral tension problem.
* It is designed so encodings and procedures can be falsified or retired without touching the canonical statement.
* The global rules that constrain effective layer behavior, encoding fairness, and tension scales are written in the shared TU charters and not repeated here in full.

All later references to Block 0 or to the semantics choice in this problem refer back to this section.

## 1. Canonical problem and status

### 1.1 Canonical statement

Let zeta(s) be the Riemann zeta function, initially defined for complex s with real part greater than 1 by the convergent series

```txt
zeta(s) = sum_{n=1 to infinity} 1 / n^s
```

and extended to a meromorphic function on the complex plane with a single simple pole at `s = 1`.

The nontrivial zeros of zeta(s) are the zeros in the critical strip, meaning those zeros with real part strictly between 0 and 1.

The Riemann Hypothesis (RH) is the statement:

> Every nontrivial zero of zeta(s) has real part exactly `1/2`.

Equivalently, if `zeta(s) = 0` and the real part of s is strictly between 0 and 1, then `Re(s) = 1/2`.

This is a central open problem of analytic number theory and of modern mathematics as a whole.

### 1.2 Status and difficulty

RH has remained open since Riemann's 1859 memoir. Partial results include:

* All nontrivial zeros lie in the critical strip `0 < Re(s) < 1` within the standard analytic continuation and functional equation framework.
* Infinitely many zeros lie on the critical line `Re(s) = 1/2`.
* A positive proportion of zeros are known to lie on the critical line.
* Many deep theorems in prime number theory, in particular about error terms in the prime number theorem and related counting functions, are equivalent to, or would follow from, RH.

No proof or disproof is known. The problem is widely believed to be extremely difficult and is one of the Clay Mathematics Institute Millennium Prize Problems.

### 1.3 Role in the BlackHole project

Within the BlackHole S problem collection, Q001 plays three roles:

1. It is the root example of a spectral_tension problem, where analytic spectral data and arithmetic structure must cohere.
2. It anchors the family of L function and number theoretic spectral problems (Q002, Q003, Q015, Q018, Q019).
3. It provides a clean setting to test the Tension Universe encoding of:

   * spectral fields,
   * arithmetic observables,
   * tension functionals and counterfactual worlds.

## 2. Position in the BlackHole graph

This block records how Q001 sits inside the BlackHole graph as nodes and edges among Q001–Q125. Each edge is listed with a one line reason that points to a concrete component, constraint, or tension type.

### 2.1 Upstream problems

These problems provide prerequisites, tools, or foundations that Q001 relies on at the effective layer.

* Q016 (BH_MATH_ZFC_CH_L3_016)
  Reason: Supplies effective layer contracts for auditable countable ladders, deterministic region families, and set based state space handling that are reused here.

* Q018 (BH_MATH_RANDOM_MATRIX_ZEROS_L3_018)

* Q019 (BH_MATH_DIOPH_DENSITY_L3_019)
  Reason: Supplies reusable audit patterns for coupling discrete arithmetic summaries to continuous like feature encodings under a frozen procedure.

### 2.2 Downstream problems

These problems are reuse targets of Q001 components or depend on Q001 style spectral tension structure.

* Q002 (BH_MATH_GRH_L3_002)
  Reason: Reuses the `SpectralTensionScore_RH` interface and the admissible encoding tuple pattern as a template for L function families.

### 2.3 Parallel problems

Parallel nodes share similar tension types but no direct component dependence.

* Q036 (BH_PHYS_HIGH_TC_MECH_L3_036)
  Reason: Both use spectral_tension style functionals that compare structured spectra with macroscopic summaries under frozen observables.

* Q039 (BH_PHYS_QTURBULENCE_L3_039)
  Reason: Both use multi scale region families and invariant style summaries to diagnose complex field behavior without deep generative rules.

### 2.4 Cross domain edges

Cross domain edges connect Q001 to problems in other domains that can reuse its patterns and components.

* Q032 (BH_PHYS_QTHERMO_L3_032)
  Reason: Can reuse frozen spectral mismatch functionals for comparing microscopic spectra with macroscopic summary observables.

* Q040 (BH_PHYS_QBLACKHOLE_INFO_L3_040)
  Reason: Can reuse region ladder audits and spectral mismatch baselines for information encoding studies.

* Q059 (BH_CS_INFO_THERMODYN_L3_059)
  Reason: Reuses the tension between a structured spectrum and information theoretic observables under a fixed encoding instance.

* Q123 (BH_AI_INTERP_L3_123)
  Reason: Reuses the counterfactual separation protocol and the idea of interpreting internal representations as structured spectra, at the effective layer.

## 3. Tension Universe encoding (effective layer)

All content in this block is at the effective layer and respects the semantics choice in Block 0. We only describe:

* state spaces,
* observables and fields,
* invariants and tension scores,
* singular sets and domain restrictions.

We do not describe any hidden generative rules or construction of internal TU fields from raw data.

### 3.1 State space and minimal structure lock

We assume the existence of a semantic state space

```txt
M
```

with the following interpretation at the effective layer:

* Each element `m` in `M` represents a coherent zeta world configuration, consisting of:

  * local spectral summaries for zeta(s) in bounded regions of the critical strip,
  * local arithmetic summaries related to primes or prime powers in corresponding ranges,
  * metadata about completeness and regularity needed for audits.

We do not specify how these configurations are constructed from raw numerical computations or proofs.

We assume the following minimal structure, just enough to make refinement and audits meaningful:

* `M` is a set of states.

* `Par` is a subset of `R^k` for some finite k, containing resolution parameters used by the encoding.

* A `LadderSpec` deterministically maps an integer index k to a resolution parameter `r_k` in `Par`.

* For each `r_k`, `LadderSpec` also determines the concrete engineering knobs that affect observables, at minimum:

  * the region height `ΔT_k`,
  * the histogram dimension `N_spec(k)`,
  * the anchor count `N_anchor(k)` or an equivalent rule.

* Every observable defined in this file is a well defined map on a restricted domain `M_reg` defined in Block 3.6.

* Any sup over a family of regions is always taken over a countable family parameterized by an explicit ladder index.

Engineering interface, for external reproducibility:

* A state `m_k` at resolution `r_k` can be represented externally as a serializable object

  ```txt
  m_k = {
    resolution_id: r_k,
    region_id -> zero_features,
    interval_id -> arith_features,
    metadata
  }
  ```

  where `zero_features` and `arith_features` are finite dimensional vectors defined below. This is an engineering interface, not an ontological claim.

### 3.2 Effective observables and admissible encoding class

We next define observables and the admissible encoding class that together determine RH mismatch and tension. All observables below are defined on `M_reg`.

For compactness, inputs will be written in combined form, for example `m_R` for a state plus a region.

#### 3.2.1 Local spectral histogram observable

```txt
H_zero(m_R) in R^{N_spec(k)}
```

* Input: `m_R` denotes a state `m` paired with a bounded region `R` in the critical strip, where `R` is one element of a deterministic, countable family tied to some `r_k`.
* Output: a fixed length histogram vector summarizing zero statistics in `R`.

Construction rule inside the encoding tuple:

* For each `R` with imaginary part range `[T, T + ΔT_k]`, the encoding uses a fixed binning scheme tied to `r_k`:

  * divide `[T, T + ΔT_k]` into `N_spec(k)` equal bins,
  * count encoded zeros per bin,
  * optionally normalize counts by `ΔT_k`.
* The binning and normalization choice is part of the frozen encoding tuple.

Whenever we speak about norms we use an L2 norm on this fixed finite dimensional representation.

#### 3.2.2 Local arithmetic feature observable

```txt
A_prime(m_I) in R^{N_anchor(k)}
```

* Input: `m_I` denotes a state `m` paired with an interval `I = [X, Y]` chosen from a deterministic, countable family coupled to regions.
* Output: a fixed length feature vector summarizing prime distribution features on `I`.

Example feature family:

* values of `pi(x_j) - li(x_j)` at a frozen set of anchor points `{x_j}` inside `I`,
* discrete differences between consecutive anchors.

Data contract note:

* `pi` and `li` conventions, plus any approximation method, must be declared as part of the arithmetic data protocol inside the encoding tuple, and must be constant across all evaluations of that tuple.

Finite value lock:

* For all `m` in `M_reg` and admissible `I`, `A_prime(m_I)` is finite by definition of `M_reg`.

Anchor rule:

* given an interval `I` and resolution parameter `r_k`, define a finite anchor set `Anchors(I, r_k)` by a declared deterministic rule.
* this rule is part of the encoding tuple and identical for all experiments under that tuple.

#### 3.2.3 Spectral mismatch with explicit metric

```txt
DeltaS_spec(m_R) >= 0
```

Let

* `h(m_R)` be the histogram `H_zero(m_R)`,
* `h_ref(R, r_k)` be the frozen reference histogram for region `R` at resolution `r_k`.

Define

```txt
DeltaS_spec(m_R) = sqrt( sum_j ( h_j(m_R) - h_ref_j(R, r_k) )^2 )
```

Properties:

* `DeltaS_spec(m_R) >= 0`.
* `DeltaS_spec(m_R) = 0` if and only if `h(m_R)` agrees with `h_ref(R, r_k)` within the declared numerical tolerance for that `r_k`.

#### 3.2.4 Arithmetic mismatch with explicit metric

```txt
DeltaS_arith(m_I) >= 0
```

Let

* `a(m_I)` be the feature vector `A_prime(m_I)` evaluated on `Anchors(I, r_k)`,
* `a_ref(I, r_k)` be the frozen reference arithmetic feature vector on the same anchors.

Define

```txt
DeltaS_arith(m_I) = sqrt( sum_j ( a_j(m_I) - a_ref_j(I, r_k) )^2 )
```

Properties:

* `DeltaS_arith(m_I) >= 0`.
* `DeltaS_arith(m_I) = 0` if and only if `a(m_I)` agrees with `a_ref(I, r_k)` within the declared tolerance model.

#### 3.2.5 Coupling rule between regions and intervals

To relate spectral and arithmetic summaries, we fix a deterministic coupling rule as an explicit encoding choice.

Let a vertical region be specified as

```txt
R(T, r_k) = { s : Re(s) in [0, 1], Im(s) in [T, T + ΔT_k] }
```

for some `T` on a declared grid and a fixed height `ΔT_k` determined by `LadderSpec`.

Coupling choice used by this encoding tuple:

```txt
I(T, r_k) = [exp(T), exp(T + ΔT_k)]
```

Operational constraint:

* All evaluations used to form mismatch and tension must use coupled pairs `(R(T, r_k), I(T, r_k))` produced by the frozen coupling rule.
* This removes any free choice to adjust intervals after seeing data.

If a future version uses a different coupling rule, it must appear as a different admissible encoding tuple, not a local edit.

#### 3.2.6 Unified mismatch and tension definition, single weight lock

To avoid duplicate weight families, this file uses one unified aggregation for both mismatch and tension.

Define, for a state `m` at a coupled pair `(R, I)`:

```txt
Tension_RH(m) = w_spec * DeltaS_spec(m_R) + w_arith * DeltaS_arith(m_I)
```

Weight lock:

* `w_spec + w_arith = 1`.
* `w_spec` and `w_arith` lie in `[0.2, 0.8]`.
* The allowed values of `(w_spec, w_arith)` are taken from a finite discrete menu specified at the charter level.
* Once an encoding tuple chooses one such pair, it cannot vary inside this problem.

There is no separate `DeltaS_RH` in this version. The unified scalar `Tension_RH` is the only combined score.

#### 3.2.7 Admissible encoding class Enc_RH

To prevent post hoc reference selection, we define an admissible encoding class that locks references, weights, couplings, ladders, and tolerances.

Finite encoding class:

```txt
Enc_RH = { Enc_RH^1, Enc_RH^2, ..., Enc_RH^J }
```

Each encoding tuple has the form

```txt
Enc = (Ref_spec, Ref_arith, w_spec, w_arith, CouplingRule, LadderSpec, ArithmeticDataProtocol, ToleranceModel)
```

and every component is chosen from a finite option list specified at the charter level.

Admissible reference class for spectral data:

* `Ref_spec` is selected from a finite library built only from:

  * closed form baseline densities and envelopes consistent with standard analytic number theory, including Riemann von Mangoldt style expectations,
  * optional random matrix inspired reference ensembles specified in advance.
* `Ref_spec` may depend on `(R, r_k)`.
* `Ref_spec` is not allowed to be fitted to evaluation zero tables after inspection.

Admissible reference class for arithmetic data:

* `Ref_arith` is selected from a finite library built only from:

  * baseline prime distribution approximations and envelopes consistent with standard analytic number theory,
  * explicit bounds or benchmark envelopes defined independently of the evaluation dataset.
* `Ref_arith` may depend on `(I, r_k)`.
* `Ref_arith` cannot be chosen or tuned after seeing evaluation results.

Coupling and ladder lock:

* `CouplingRule` is a declared mapping `R(T, r_k) -> I(T, r_k)` listed in the encoding menu.
* `LadderSpec` defines the ladder `r_k` and the induced region families and observable dimensions.
* Both are fixed before any evaluation for that tuple.

Arithmetic data protocol lock:

* `ArithmeticDataProtocol` specifies:

  * the source of prime summary inputs, or a deterministic computation method,
  * the conventions for `pi`, `li`, and any approximation or rounding rule,
  * how these choices map into the feature vector `A_prime`.
* It is fixed before evaluation for that tuple.

Tolerance model:

* `ToleranceModel` gathers all explicit numerical tolerances, including:

  * histogram error margins for `DeltaS_spec`,
  * feature error margins for `DeltaS_arith`,
  * rules by which epsilon and delta thresholds are derived in Block 6.3.
* Each `ToleranceModel` used here is chosen from a finite charter level library.

Fairness and audit constraint:

* For each encoding tuple in `Enc_RH`:

  * the reference choices, weights, coupling rule, ladder, arithmetic protocol, and tolerance model are declared in full,
  * a cryptographic hash of the full encoding spec text is published before any experiment in Block 6 is run.

Any adaptation of references, weights, coupling, ladders, tolerances, or arithmetic protocol after seeing outcomes is a failure of the encoding procedure, not evidence about RH.

### 3.3 Optional effective tension tensor note

Some TU pages use an effective tension tensor notation. In this file it is treated as optional reporting, not as a free extra degree of freedom.

If a tensor is reported, it must be a deterministic transform of the already frozen scalar `Tension_RH(m)` and metadata already present in the encoding tuple.

Minimal contract for any reported tensor:

* Index sets: finite, explicitly listed in the encoding tuple.
* Component ranges: bounded, explicitly listed in the encoding tuple.
* No additional tunable functions are allowed beyond what is already locked by `Enc`.

A compliant example template:

```txt
T_ij(m) = G_ij( meta(m), Enc ) * Tension_RH(m)
```

where `G_ij` is a frozen bounded table or frozen bounded feature map specified inside the encoding tuple.

If no such frozen `G_ij` is declared, this file reports only the scalar `Tension_RH`.

### 3.4 Invariants and scale locked constraints

We define effective invariants using only countable, scale locked region families.

Resolution ladder and admissible region families:

* Choose a countable resolution ladder `r_k` from `LadderSpec`, indexed by `k = 1, 2, 3, ...`.
* For each `r_k`, define a countable family of admissible regions by deterministic rules.
* Any sup over regions is taken over a declared region family at some `r_k`.

1. Critical strip histogram invariance (scale locked)

Let `Regions_line(r_k)` be the admissible family of vertical regions at scale `r_k` constructed by a deterministic rule.

Define

```txt
I_line_k(m) = sup_{R in Regions_line(r_k)} DeltaS_spec(m_R)
I_line(m)   = sup_k I_line_k(m)
```

2. Spectral statistics invariance (scale locked)

Let `Regions_stats(r_k)` be another deterministic family of regions at scale `r_k`. Let `stat_zero` be a fixed statistic extractor operating on the histograms used for `DeltaS_spec`, and let `stat_ref(R, r_k)` be derived from `Ref_spec` under the same tuple.

Define

```txt
I_stats_k(m) = sup_{R in Regions_stats(r_k)} | stat_zero(m_R) - stat_ref(R, r_k) |
I_stats(m)   = sup_k I_stats_k(m)
```

### 3.5 World representing sequences, deterministic construction rule

A world representing sequence is not an arbitrary existence claim in this file.

Definition:

* Fix an encoding tuple `Enc` in `Enc_RH`.
* Fix a dataset source or generator specified by the protocol of an experiment in Block 6.
* The procedure in that experiment deterministically constructs a sequence `(m_k)` by applying the frozen ladder, region families, coupling rule, and feature extraction rules.

A sequence `(m_k)` is world representing for `(Enc, ExperimentID, DatasetID)` if and only if it is produced by that declared deterministic procedure, with all required inputs present.

This turns statements in Blocks 4 and 5 into auditable protocol statements, not free selection.

### 3.6 Singular set and domain restrictions

Some observables are undefined or not finite if required encoded data are incomplete or inconsistent. Define a singular set:

```txt
S_sing is a subset of M
m is in S_sing if any required DeltaS_spec or DeltaS_arith call is undefined or not finite under the frozen Enc
```

Auditable out of domain reasons, recorded as metadata:

* missing spectral bins needed to build `H_zero` at some `r_k`
* missing anchor values needed to build `A_prime` at some `r_k`
* mismatch between declared region families and available region ids
* mismatch between declared coupling rule and available interval ids
* failure of declared arithmetic data protocol to produce required values
* tolerance model preconditions violated, for example incompatible dimension

Domain rule:

* All RH related analysis is restricted to `M_reg`, where `M_reg = M \ S_sing`.
* If an experiment attempts to evaluate required observables on a state outside `M_reg`, the outcome is recorded as out of domain and treated as inconclusive for that evaluation, not as evidence about RH.

---

## 4. Tension principle for this problem

This block states how Q001 is characterized as a tension problem within TU at the effective layer, with refinement and encoding class locks.

### 4.1 Core tension functional, already locked by Enc

The core tension functional is the unified scalar defined in Block 3.2.6:

```txt
Tension_RH(m) = w_spec * DeltaS_spec(m_R) + w_arith * DeltaS_arith(m_I)
```

There are no additional free coefficients in this version.

### 4.2 World T operational statement, low tension band across refinement

At the effective layer, RH true is expressed as an operational low tension pattern relative to a fixed encoding tuple and a fixed experiment protocol.

Operational statement:

* Fix `Enc` in `Enc_RH`.
* Fix an experiment protocol in Block 6 that constructs a world representing sequence `(m_k)` deterministically from a declared dataset.

World T is the counterfactual pattern in which the resulting tension sequence eventually stays in a small band:

```txt
sup_{k >= k0} Tension_RH(m_k) <= epsilon_RH(Enc, ExperimentID)
```

where:

* `k0` depends on `Enc` and the experiment protocol,
* `epsilon_RH(Enc, ExperimentID)` is derived by the calibration rule in Block 6.3 and is frozen together with the tuple and the experiment spec.

This is a pattern specification for an encoding and a protocol. It is not a proof claim about RH.

### 4.3 World F operational statement, persistent high tension separator threshold

World F is the counterfactual pattern in which the resulting tension sequence eventually stays above a separator threshold.

Operational statement:

* Fix `Enc` in `Enc_RH`.
* Fix an experiment protocol in Block 6 that constructs a world representing sequence `(m_k)` deterministically.

World F is the pattern in which:

```txt
inf_{k >= k0} Tension_RH(m_k) >= delta_RH(Enc, ExperimentID)
```

where `delta_RH(Enc, ExperimentID)` is an operational separator threshold derived in Block 6.3.

Interpretation constraint:

* `delta_RH` is a calibration artifact of the encoding and the chosen family of mock worlds used in Experiment 2.
* It is not claimed to be a theorem level lower bound that covers all logically possible RH false behaviors.

---

## 5. Counterfactual tension worlds

We outline two counterfactual worlds, described strictly at the effective layer and always relative to a fixed `Enc` in `Enc_RH` and a fixed experiment protocol.

* World T: RH true operational pattern.
* World F: RH false operational pattern.

Each world is described through observable tension patterns. No hidden construction rules are provided and no canonical answer is stored inside any encoding parameter.

### 5.1 World T (operational low tension)

In World T, for any fixed encoding tuple `Enc` in `Enc_RH` and any fixed protocol that deterministically constructs `(m_k)`:

1. Critical strip behavior

   The invariant `I_line(m_k)` remains small and stable across k according to the tolerance model.

2. Spectral statistics

   `I_stats(m_k)` matches, within the tolerance model in `Enc`, the frozen `stat_ref` baselines derived from `Ref_spec`.

3. Arithmetic profiles

   `DeltaS_arith(m_I)` stays within the tolerance model tied to `Ref_arith` across coupled intervals.

4. Global tension band

   There exists `k0` such that

   ```txt
   sup_{k >= k0} Tension_RH(m_k) <= epsilon_RH(Enc, ExperimentID)
   ```

### 5.2 World F (operational high tension)

In World F, for any fixed encoding tuple `Enc` in `Enc_RH` and any fixed protocol that deterministically constructs `(m_k)`:

1. Critical strip deviation

   There exists `k0` such that `I_line(m_k)` is bounded away from zero for all `k >= k0` under the calibrated thresholding.

2. Spectral statistics anomaly

   `I_stats(m_k)` deviates from `stat_ref` in a way that does not shrink under increasing k, relative to the tolerance model.

3. Arithmetic distortion

   There exist coupled intervals where `DeltaS_arith(m_I)` violates the tolerance envelope tied to `Ref_arith`.

4. Global separator threshold

   There exists `k0` such that

   ```txt
   inf_{k >= k0} Tension_RH(m_k) >= delta_RH(Enc, ExperimentID)
   ```

### 5.3 Interpretive note

These counterfactual worlds do not claim to construct TU internal fields from raw data. They only assert that if a protocol produces a world representing sequence under a locked encoding tuple, then the observable tension patterns differ as described.

They are templates for how RH true versus RH false operational patterns look under this effective layer encoding, not storage locations for the canonical answer.

---

## 6. Falsifiability, discriminating experiments, and threshold calibration

This block specifies experiments and protocols at the effective layer that can:

* test coherence of the Q001 encoding,
* discriminate between alternative admissible encoding tuples,
* falsify specific TU encoding tuples for Q001,
* define thresholds `epsilon_RH(Enc, ExperimentID)` and `delta_RH(Enc, ExperimentID)`.

These experiments do not prove or disprove RH. They test encoding procedures and encoding tuples.

### 6.1 Experiment 1: Numerical spectral tension profile (pre registered encoding)

Scope:

* Tests a frozen TU encoding tuple `Enc` for Q001 and its procedure.
* Does not test the canonical truth of RH.

Goal:

* Test whether the frozen `Tension_RH` functional and reference classes produce stable, auditable tension profiles on published numerical datasets.

Setup:

* Input data: published tables of nontrivial zeros up to a stated height range, plus prime summary inputs required by `ArithmeticDataProtocol` over coupled ranges.

* Declare, as part of the tuple and protocol:

  * the ladder `r_k` and induced region families,
  * the coupling rule with `ΔT_k` determined by the ladder,
  * the anchor rules and arithmetic conventions.

* Freeze a specific encoding tuple `Enc` in `Enc_RH`:

  * select `Ref_spec`,
  * select `Ref_arith`,
  * fix `(w_spec, w_arith)` from the discrete menu,
  * fix `LadderSpec`, `CouplingRule`, `ArithmeticDataProtocol`, `ToleranceModel`,
  * publish a hash of the full encoding spec before evaluation.

Protocol:

1. For each k in a declared range, construct the state `m_k` deterministically using the published inputs and the frozen feature extraction rules.
2. For each coupled pair produced by the coupling rule at that k, compute `DeltaS_spec(m_R)` and `DeltaS_arith(m_I)`.
3. Compute `Tension_RH(m_k)` for each k.
4. Compute `I_line_k(m_k)` and `I_stats_k(m_k)` using the deterministic region families.
5. Report all outputs with the full encoding tuple, its hash, and all out of domain metadata if any.

Metrics:

* The sequence `Tension_RH(m_k)` across k.
* The sequences `I_line_k(m_k)` and `I_stats_k(m_k)` across k.
* Sensitivity under neighboring choices in the discrete encoding menu, when such comparisons are pre registered.

Falsification conditions:

* If, under the frozen tuple, `Tension_RH(m_k)` has uncontrolled jumps across adjacent k that cannot be attributed to declared ladder effects or tolerance effects, the tuple is rejected as not robust.
* If post evaluation changes to references, weights, coupling, ladder, tolerances, or arithmetic protocol are required to obtain stable behavior, the encoding procedure is rejected as not admissible for Q001.
* If neighboring discrete menu choices flip qualitative conclusions in a way that violates the audit expectations set by the tolerance model, the tuple is rejected as non auditable.

Boundary note:

* Falsifying an encoding tuple in this experiment is not the same as solving the canonical statement.

### 6.2 Experiment 2: Model world comparison with mock zeta like functions (class separation)

Scope:

* Tests whether a frozen encoding tuple can separate RH like and non RH like mock families.
* Does not test the canonical truth of RH.

Goal:

* Test whether the encoding can separate RH like versus non RH like spectral families under the same admissible encoding tuple, without tuning after seeing outcomes.

Setup:

* Construct or select zeta like families:

  * Family T: functions whose constructed zeros lie on a single vertical line.
  * Family F: functions whose constructed zeros include a declared fraction off that line.

* For each function, generate synthetic spectral and arithmetic like summaries to populate states `m_k` on the ladder, using a declared generator rule.

* Freeze the same encoding tuple `Enc` in `Enc_RH` as used for calibration.

Protocol:

1. For each family element and each k, construct `m_k` deterministically from the declared generator rule and the frozen ladder.
2. Compute `DeltaS_spec`, `DeltaS_arith`, and `Tension_RH` for all such `m_k`.
3. Compare tension distributions between Family T and Family F across k.

Metrics:

* Mean and variance of `Tension_RH` for Family T and Family F.
* Separation between the distributions at each k.
* Stability of separation across k.
* Agreement between separation and the known construction labels.

Falsification conditions:

* If the frozen encoding fails to separate Family T from Family F across k, the tuple is rejected as misaligned for Q001.
* If the frozen encoding systematically assigns lower tension to Family F than to Family T, the tuple is rejected as directionally incorrect.

Boundary note:

* Falsifying an encoding tuple in this experiment is not the same as solving the canonical statement.

### 6.3 Calibration of epsilon_RH and delta_RH, operational thresholds

The thresholds `epsilon_RH(Enc, ExperimentID)` and `delta_RH(Enc, ExperimentID)` are calibration artifacts used to define operational World T and World F patterns for this encoding and protocol.

Calibration rule:

* For each encoding tuple `Enc` and a fixed calibration protocol for Experiment 2:

  1. Run Experiment 2 on Family T and Family F.
  2. Let `Tension_T(k)` and `Tension_F(k)` denote the tension distributions on each family at scale k.

Define `epsilon_RH(Enc, Experiment2)`:

* a fixed quantile, such as the 95th percentile, of the pooled `Tension_T(k)` values across a pre declared k range, rounded according to `ToleranceModel`.

Define `delta_RH(Enc, Experiment2)`:

* a fixed quantile, such as the 5th percentile, of the pooled `Tension_F(k)` values across the same k range, rounded according to `ToleranceModel`.

Constraints:

* Quantile choices, k ranges, and rounding rules are specified in `ToleranceModel` before running experiments.
* Changing calibration rules requires a charter level update, not a local edit.

Interpretation constraint:

* These thresholds calibrate separation for the chosen mock world family, under the chosen protocol.
* They are not asserted as theorem level constants about the canonical RH.

## 7. AI and WFGY engineering spec

This block describes how Q001 can be used as an engineering module for AI systems within the WFGY framework, at the effective layer.

### 7.1 Training signals

We define training signals that encourage tension aware reasoning under the frozen encoding tuple.

1. `signal_zero_spectrum_stability`

   * Definition: a penalty proportional to `DeltaS_spec(m_R)` evaluated on coupled inputs across declared regions.
   * Purpose: discourage internal representations that imply spectral patterns inconsistent with frozen baselines.

2. `signal_prime_error_profile`

   * Definition: a penalty derived from `DeltaS_arith(m_I)` evaluated on coupled inputs across declared intervals.
   * Purpose: discourage internal representations that imply arithmetic profiles outside the frozen tolerance envelope.

3. `signal_spectral_tension_score`

   * Definition: the scalar `Tension_RH(m)` under the frozen admissible tuple.
   * Purpose: provide a single measurable indicator of RH encoding tension.

4. `signal_counterfactual_consistency`

   * Definition: a consistency penalty when the model mixes World T and World F assumptions in the same explanation under a declared stance prompt.
   * Purpose: enforce separation of counterfactual assumptions rather than blended narratives.

### 7.2 Architectural patterns

We outline module patterns that reuse Q001 structures without revealing any deep TU generative rules.

1. `SpectralTensionHead`

   * Role: produce an estimate of `Tension_RH` as an auxiliary output from internal representations.
   * Interface: internal embeddings to scalar tension estimate, optionally with decomposition into spectral and arithmetic parts.

2. `ArithmeticConsistencyFilter`

   * Role: score candidate statements about primes for compatibility with frozen `Ref_arith` envelopes and the declared arithmetic protocol.
   * Interface: candidate statement representation to soft score or mask.

3. `TU_SpecField_Observer`

   * Role: extract simplified spectral summaries compatible with `H_zero` from internal representations.
   * Interface: internal embeddings to low dimensional spectral summary.

### 7.3 Evaluation harness

1. Task selection

   * Use analytic number theory prompts where RH affects bounds or error term narratives.

2. Conditions

   * Baseline: no explicit Q001 tension modules.
   * TU encoded: include `SpectralTensionHead` and `ArithmeticConsistencyFilter` driven by the frozen encoding tuple.

3. Metrics

   * Accuracy under RH assumed prompts.
   * Consistency across RH assumed versus RH denying prompts.
   * Stability of multi step reasoning without contradictions.

### 7.4 60 second reproduction protocol

Baseline setup:

* Prompt: explain links between zeta zeros, prime distribution, error terms, and random matrix heuristics.
* Log: response text and self reported uncertainty markers.

TU encoded setup:

* Prompt: same, plus require an explicit tension narrative that references `Tension_RH`, separates World T and World F, and cites the encoding tuple hash.
* Log: response text plus any produced tension scores.

Comparison metric:

* Rate structural coherence, linkage quality, and counterfactual separation quality.

What to log:

* Prompts, outputs, encoding tuple hash, and any auxiliary tension traces.

## 8. Cross problem transfer template

This block describes reusable components produced by Q001 and how they transfer.

### 8.1 Reusable components produced by this problem

1. ComponentName: `SpectralTensionScore_RH`

   * Type: functional
   * Minimal interface:

     * Inputs: `local_zero_histogram`, `local_arith_features`, `encoding_tuple_id`
     * Output: `tension_value` (nonnegative scalar)
   * Preconditions:

     * `encoding_tuple_id` points to a frozen admissible tuple in `Enc_RH`.
     * Summaries are generated by deterministic region, interval, and anchor rules.

2. ComponentName: `ZetaSpectrumField_Descriptor`

### 8.2 Direct reuse targets

1. Q002 (Generalized Riemann Hypothesis)

   * Reused component: `SpectralTensionScore_RH`, `ZetaSpectrumField_Descriptor`.
   * Why it transfers: the same spectral_tension form extends from zeta(s) to L function families.
   * What changes: local summaries are indexed by characters or family parameters.

2. Q003 (Birch and Swinnerton Dyer conjecture)

   * Reused component: `CounterfactualSpectralWorld_Template`.
   * Why it transfers: BSD couples L function spectral behavior to arithmetic invariants, allowing similar world separation patterns.
   * What changes: arithmetic summaries refer to elliptic curve invariants rather than primes.

3. Q018 (Pair correlation of zeros)

   * Reused component: `ZetaSpectrumField_Descriptor`.
   * Why it transfers: Q018 makes fine spectral statistics the primary observable.
   * What changes: higher order correlation features become mandatory outputs.

4. Q036 (High temperature superconductivity mechanism)

   * Reused component: `CounterfactualSpectralWorld_Template`.
   * Why it transfers: spectral_tension and counterfactual separation patterns apply to physical spectra.
   * What changes: model families are Hamiltonians, observables are energy level summaries.

## 9. TU roadmap and verification levels

This block positions Q001 on the TU verification ladder and declares next measurable steps.

### 9.1 Current levels

* E_level: E2

  * A coherent effective encoding of RH via spectral_tension is specified.
  * Experiments exist that can falsify an encoding tuple or procedure and calibrate operational thresholds.

* N_level: N2

  * The linkage between spectral and arithmetic observables is explicit at the effective layer.
  * Counterfactual worlds are specified as auditable operational patterns using a fixed ladder and fixed protocols.

### 9.2 Next measurable step toward E3

To move from E2 to E3, implement at least one of the following in practice:

1. A public reproducible prototype that, for a declared encoding tuple `Enc`:

   * computes `Tension_RH(m_k)`, `I_line_k(m_k)`, and `I_stats_k(m_k)` on a declared ladder using public datasets,
   * publishes the full encoding tuple, region families, coupling rule, arithmetic protocol, tolerance model, and pre registration hash.

2. A public benchmark on mock zeta like families that demonstrates stable separation of Family T versus Family F under a frozen encoding tuple, including:

   * published code and data for mock families,
   * published tension distributions,
   * independent replication by external groups.

Both steps operate at the effective layer because they work with observable summaries and audited encoding tuples, not with any deep TU generative rule.

### 9.3 Long term role in the TU program

Q001 is expected to serve as:

* a reference node for spectral_tension problems across mathematics and physics,
* a calibration ground for auditable tension encodings that avoid proof claims while staying testable,
* a bridge node connecting pure mathematics, mathematical physics, and AI interpretability via shared spectral tension structure.

## 10. Elementary but precise explanation

The classical Riemann Hypothesis says:

> In the critical strip, all nontrivial zeros of zeta(s) lie on the line with real part equal to `1/2`.

Why it matters:

* the pattern of these zeros controls how primes fluctuate around their average distribution,
* if the zeros are well organized, prime fluctuations are constrained.

In the Tension Universe view, we do not claim a proof. Instead, we define an effective tension score:

* one part measures how far observed zero histograms deviate from a frozen spectral reference,
* one part measures how far prime summary features deviate from a frozen arithmetic reference,
* both are combined into a single number `Tension_RH` under a frozen encoding tuple.

The anti cheat idea is simple:

* references, weights, coupling rule, ladder, arithmetic protocol, and tolerances are frozen before evaluation,
* the full encoding spec is hashed before evaluation,
* no post evaluation tuning is admissible.

Then we compare two counterfactual operational patterns:

* World T is the pattern where a declared protocol produces tension that eventually stays below a calibrated band threshold.
* World F is the pattern where the declared protocol produces tension that eventually stays above a calibrated separator threshold.

This does not decide RH. It does something different and testable:

* it makes the RH like versus non RH like operational distinction auditable at the effective layer,
* it provides explicit observables and experiments that can falsify bad encoding tuples,
* it defines reusable components for other spectral tension problems.

Q001 is therefore a prototype for spectral tension problem encodings in TU and a benchmark for encoding an open problem without crossing into deep generative rules.

## Tension Universe effective layer footer

This page is part of the WFGY / Tension Universe S problem collection.

### Scope of claims

* The goal of this document is to specify an effective layer encoding of the named problem.
* It does not claim to prove or disprove the canonical statement in Section 1.
* It does not introduce any new theorem beyond what is already established in the cited literature.
* It should not be cited as evidence that the corresponding open problem has been solved.

### Charter references

This page should be read together with the following charters:

* [TU Effective Layer Charter](../Charters/TU_EFFECTIVE_LAYER_CHARTER.md)
* [TU Encoding and Fairness Charter](../Charters/TU_ENCODING_AND_FAIRNESS_CHARTER.md)
* [TU Tension Scale Charter](../Charters/TU_TENSION_SCALE_CHARTER.md)
* [TU Global Guardrails](../Charters/TU_GLOBAL_GUARDRAILS.md)

### Effective layer boundary

* All objects used here (state spaces `M`, observables, invariants, tension scores, counterfactual worlds) live at the effective layer.
* No step in this file gives a constructive mapping from raw experimental or simulation data into internal TU fields.
* No step exposes any deep TU generative rule or any first principle axiom system.

### Encoding and fairness

* Admissible encoding classes, reference profiles, weight menus, coupling rules, ladder specs, arithmetic data protocols, and tolerance models used in this page are constrained by the shared TU charters listed above.
* For every encoding class referenced here:

  * its definition, parameter menus, reference families, and protocol contracts are frozen at the charter level before any evaluation,
  * these choices may depend on general mathematical considerations and on public benchmark selections, but not on the unknown truth value of this specific problem,
  * no encoding is allowed to hide the canonical answer as an uninterpreted field, label, or parameter.

### Tension scale and thresholds

* All mismatch terms `DeltaS_*` and tension functionals in this file are treated as dimensionless or normalized quantities, defined up to a fixed monotone rescaling specified in the TU Tension Scale Charter.
* Thresholds such as `epsilon_*`, `delta_*`, and experiment cutoffs are interpreted relative to that fixed scale.
* Changing the tension scale requires an explicit update of the TU Tension Scale Charter, not an edit of individual problem files.

### Falsifiability and experiments

* Experiments described in this document are tests of TU encodings, not tests of the underlying canonical problem itself.
* The rule "falsifying a TU encoding is not the same as solving the canonical statement" applies globally, even where it is not restated.
* When required observables cannot be reliably estimated in practice, the outcome is recorded as inconclusive, not as confirmation.

### Interaction with established results

* All encodings and counterfactual worlds described here are required to respect known theorems and hard constraints in the relevant field.
* If a later analysis finds a concrete conflict with established results, the correct procedure is to update or retire the encoding under the TU charters, not to reinterpret those results.

### Versioning and non mutation policy

* This file is a versioned specification within the WFGY / Tension Universe research program.
* Definitions and symbols in this file are frozen for this version.
* Revisions, if needed, must be published as a new versioned file or accompanied by an explicit changelog entry and must not silently alter prior definitions.
* All changes to encoding classes, reference libraries, weight menus, coupling rules, ladder specs, arithmetic protocols, or tolerance models that affect multiple problems should be made at the charter level, not by local edits to this file.

### Program note

* This page is an experimental specification within the ongoing WFGY / Tension Universe program.
* All structures and parameter choices are provisional and may be revised in future versions, subject to the constraints above.

## 0. Effective layer disclaimer

All statements in this entry are made strictly at the effective layer of the Tension Universe (TU) framework.

* We only specify:

  * state spaces and scenario libraries,
  * effective observables and tension functionals,
  * invariants, singular sets, and refinement procedures,
  * counterfactual worlds described in terms of observable tension patterns.
* We do not specify:

  * any TU deep generative rule,
  * any explicit axiom system for TU,
  * any constructive mapping from microscopic Hamiltonians or raw experimental data to TU internal fields.

Scope and limitations:

* The goal of Q027 is to define an effective layer encoding of the question:

  > How far can environment induced decoherence, by itself, account for the emergence of classical behavior, and where do fundamental limits appear?

* This page does not:

  * prove or disprove the canonical decoherence claims in quantum theory,
  * establish that decoherence is sufficient or insufficient in the actual universe,
  * introduce any new physical law beyond standard quantum mechanics and open system modeling.

Hybrid semantics:

* The metadata field `Semantics: hybrid` is implemented as follows:

  * continuous quantities: time scales, resource measures, and tension scores are treated as real valued observables;
  * discrete quantities: scenario labels, library indices, and pointer archetypes are treated as discrete symbols;
  * no additional semantic regime is introduced beyond this hybrid of continuous variables and discrete labels.

Domain restriction:

* All tension related quantities are evaluated only on a regular domain `M_reg` defined in Block 3.
* States that fall into the singular set `S_sing` are treated as out of domain for Q027.
* Out of domain cases are not interpreted as evidence for or against decoherence limits.

This document must not be cited as evidence that the decoherence program has been completed or refuted. It is an effective layer diagnostic and bookkeeping device that makes claims about encodings, not about ultimate physics.

## 1. Canonical problem and status

### 1.1 Canonical statement

Consider an open quantum system with a system Hilbert space `H_S`, an environment Hilbert space `H_E`, and a joint unitary evolution on `H_S ⊗ H_E`. Standard decoherence theory states that:

1. Environmental interactions drive the reduced state of the system toward a mixture in a preferred basis (pointer basis).
2. Interference terms in that basis are effectively suppressed for relevant observables.
3. Classical looking behavior emerges at macroscopic scales without modifying the unitary dynamics.

The canonical question behind Q027 is:

> At what scales, configurations, and resource regimes is environment induced decoherence alone a sufficient and essentially complete explanation of the emergence of classical outcomes, and where do fundamental limits appear that would require additional postulates, meta theories, or new physics?

More concretely, Q027 asks for the existence and characterization of:

1. Fundamental lower and upper bounds on decoherence time scales and length scales for realistic families of systems, given physical constraints on environments and couplings.
2. Regimes where no physically admissible environment model can generate the required decoherence to account for observed classical behavior, without introducing extra assumptions beyond standard quantum mechanics.
3. A principled distinction between practical limits (engineering or resource limits) and conceptual limits (where decoherence cannot, even in idealized form, provide a closed explanation).

The problem is not to propose a specific modified theory. It is to define and study the boundary between:

* a decoherence only world, and
* a world where decoherence must be supplemented by additional principles.

### 1.2 Status and difficulty

Standard decoherence theory is well developed and widely accepted as a key ingredient in understanding the quantum to classical transition. A large body of work describes:

* environment induced suppression of interference,
* pointer states and einselection,
* decoherence time scales for various model systems,
* the role of decoherence in quantum information and quantum technologies.

However, several deep questions remain open and controversial:

1. Whether decoherence alone solves the measurement problem, or merely shifts it to the emergence of definite outcomes and probabilities.
2. Whether there exist regimes (for example cosmological scales, gravitational contexts, or very large macroscopic superpositions) where decoherence explanations require environments or couplings that are themselves problematic or physically unattainable.
3. How to define and quantify the limits of decoherence when both system and environment resources are constrained by realistic physics and engineering.

These questions are partly conceptual and partly technical. They connect foundational issues about quantum theory with detailed modeling of open quantum systems. No consensus answer is known, and different interpretations of quantum mechanics give different accounts of how far decoherence can go.

### 1.3 Role in the BlackHole project

Within the BlackHole S problem collection, Q027 serves as:

1. The primary node for consistency_tension in quantum foundations between:

   * unitary micro dynamics,
   * environment induced decoherence,
   * the appearance of definite classical outcomes.
2. A bridge between Q026 (quantum measurement problem) and other physics problems that rely on decoherence like mechanisms, such as:

   * Q028 (QCD confinement and effective classical color neutrality),
   * Q036 (high temperature superconductivity mechanisms),
   * Q040 (black hole information and effective horizon classicality).
3. A template for defining finite libraries of models and refinement procedures that make limits of a mechanism testable at the effective layer, rather than purely as informal philosophical claims.

## 2. Position in the BlackHole graph

This block records how Q027 sits inside the BlackHole graph as nodes and edges among Q001–Q125. Each edge includes a one line reason pointing to a concrete component or tension type.

## 3. Tension Universe encoding (effective layer)

All content in this block is at the effective layer. We only describe:

* state spaces,
* observables and fields,
* invariants and tension scores,
* singular sets and domain restrictions,
* finite encoding libraries and refinement procedures.

We do not describe any hidden generative rules or any mapping from raw experimental data to internal TU fields.

Throughout this block, we work with an admissible encoding class

```txt
A_enc_DECOHERENCE_BOUND
```

for Q027. A specific encoding element

```txt
E_DECOH ∈ A_enc_DECOHERENCE_BOUND
```

is identified at the metadata level by `EncodingKey_Q027`, `LibraryKey_ref_Q027`, and `WeightKey_Q027`. All choices of libraries, refinement rules, and tension weights described below are part of such an encoding element and remain fixed within a given analysis run.

### 3.1 State space

We assume the existence of a semantic state space

```txt
M
```

with the following interpretation at the effective layer:

* Each element `m` in `M` represents a coherent decoherence world configuration for an open quantum system, including:

  * a class of system Hilbert spaces that represent degrees of freedom of interest,
  * a class of environment models suitable for that system,
  * coarse grained descriptions of relevant interaction strengths and time scales,
  * summaries of whether decoherence alone is claimed to account for observed classical behavior in a given scenario.

We do not construct `m` from microscopic Hamiltonians or raw lab data. We only assume that:

* For each physical scenario in which decoherence explanations are considered, there exist states `m` that encode the relevant coarse grained information needed to evaluate decoherence consistency at that scenario.

### 3.2 Effective fields and observables

We introduce the following effective observables on `M`.

1. Local decoherence time observable

   ```txt
   tau_dec(m; scenario)
   ```

   * Input: a state `m` and a labeled scenario (for example a class of experiments or physical setups).
   * Output: an effective time scale that summarizes how quickly off diagonal terms in the relevant pointer basis are claimed to be suppressed by decoherence for that scenario.

2. Classicalization time observable

   ```txt
   tau_class(m; scenario)
   ```

   * Input: a state `m` and a scenario.
   * Output: an effective time scale at which the scenario is claimed to exhibit classical behavior for all practical purposes (for example stable outcomes, negligible interference, robust records).

3. Micro dynamical mismatch observable

   ```txt
   DeltaS_micro(m; scenario)
   ```

   * Input: a state `m` and a scenario.
   * Output: a nonnegative scalar summarizing how well the claimed decoherence dynamics for that scenario can be represented by an admissible family of open system models without conflicting with unitary micro dynamics.

4. Macro classical mismatch observable

   ```txt
   DeltaS_macro(m; scenario)
   ```

   * Input: a state `m` and a scenario.
   * Output: a nonnegative scalar summarizing the mismatch between:

     * the classical behavior claimed for that scenario (such as definite outcomes and classical trajectories),
     * what would follow from the decoherence models encoded in `m` if taken as complete explanations.

5. Environment resource observable

   ```txt
   R_env(m; scenario)
   ```

   * Input: a state `m` and a scenario.
   * Output: an effective measure of environmental resources required in the decoherence models (for example number of environmental degrees of freedom, entropy capacity, or coupling strength ranges).

We only assume that all these observables are finite and well defined on a regular subset of `M` defined below.

### 3.3 Finite encoding libraries

To prevent post hoc tuning of decoherence models, we introduce finite libraries that must be fixed before tension evaluation. For a given encoding element `E_DECOH`, these libraries are uniquely determined by `LibraryKey_ref_Q027` and remain fixed across all scenarios and experiments in that analysis.

1. Scale library

   ```txt
   L_scale = { s_1, s_2, ..., s_K }
   ```

   * A finite set of labeled scale descriptors combining size, mass range, energy scale, and time scale.
   * For each scenario, only scales in `L_scale` are used when evaluating decoherence limits.

2. Environment library

   ```txt
   L_env = { E_1, E_2, ..., E_L }
   ```

   * A finite set of environment archetypes (for example gas bath, solid lattice, radiation field) with parameter ranges.
   * These archetypes define admissible environment models for decoherence explanations.

3. Pointer library

   ```txt
   L_pointer = { P_1, P_2, ..., P_M }
   ```

   * A finite set of pointer basis archetypes that encode how classical observables are identified (for example position bands, coarse grained spin directions).

Fairness constraint for libraries:

* For a given encoding element `E_DECOH`, the libraries `L_scale`, `L_env`, and `L_pointer` are fixed once for Q027 at the effective layer.
* They cannot be modified in response to the outcomes of specific scenarios or experiments.
* For a given scenario, only elements from these finite libraries may be used to define `tau_dec`, `tau_class`, and the mismatch observables.

### 3.4 Refinement procedure refine(k)

We define a refinement procedure indexed by a positive integer `k`.

1. For each `k`, define refined sub libraries:

   ```txt
   L_scale(k)   subseteq L_scale
   L_env(k)     subseteq L_env
   L_pointer(k) subseteq L_pointer
   ```

   such that:

   ```txt
   L_scale(1)   subseteq L_scale(2)   subseteq ... subseteq L_scale
   L_env(1)     subseteq L_env(2)     subseteq ... subseteq L_env
   L_pointer(1) subseteq L_pointer(2) subseteq ... subseteq L_pointer
   ```

2. The map

   ```txt
   refine(k): M -> M
   ```

   is interpreted at the effective layer as producing a state `m_k` from `m` that:

   * encodes decoherence information using only archetypes in `L_scale(k)`, `L_env(k)`, and `L_pointer(k)`,
   * respects the same physical scenario, but at a refined modeling level.

We do not specify how `refine(k)` is constructed. We only require:

* For each scenario and state `m`, the sequence of tension related observables for `m_k = refine(k)(m)` is defined and finite for all `k` up to some maximal modeling level.
* For a fixed encoding element `E_DECOH`, the definition of `refine(k)` is global and uniform across scenarios. It cannot be chosen differently for different scenarios in the same analysis run.

### 3.5 Invariants and effective constraints

Using the observables and libraries above, we define the following invariants.

1. Decoherence sufficiency gap

   ```txt
   G_suff(m; scenario) = max(0, tau_dec(m; scenario) - tau_class(m; scenario))
   ```

   This measures how much slower decoherence is than classicalization for the scenario. The larger the gap, the more it appears that classicality is being assumed rather than produced by decoherence alone.

2. Resource normalized mismatch

   For each scenario and a choice of library level `k`, define:

   ```txt
   DeltaS_env(m_k; scenario) =
     f_micro * DeltaS_micro(m_k; scenario) +
     f_macro * DeltaS_macro(m_k; scenario)
   ```

   with fixed nonnegative coefficients `f_micro` and `f_macro` that satisfy:

   ```txt
   f_micro + f_macro = 1
   ```

   The pair `(f_micro, f_macro)` is part of the encoding element `E_DECOH` and therefore determined by `WeightKey_Q027`. It does not depend on the particular scenario or data.

3. Singular set and domain restrictions

   We define the singular set:

   ```txt
   S_sing = { m in M :
              tau_dec, tau_class, DeltaS_micro, DeltaS_macro, or R_env
              are undefined or not finite for some admissible scenario }
   ```

   and the regular domain:

   ```txt
   M_reg = M \ S_sing
   ```

   We impose:

   * All Q027 tension analysis is restricted to `M_reg`.
   * Whenever an experiment would attempt to evaluate tension related quantities for a state in `S_sing`, the result is treated as out of domain rather than as evidence about decoherence limits.

### 3.6 Embedding into TU tension tensor

At the effective layer, Q027 contributes a decoherence sector to the TU tension tensor. For regular states `m` and admissible scenarios we define:

```txt
T_ij_DECOH(m; scenario) =
  S_i_DECOH(m; scenario)
  * C_j_DECOH(m; scenario)
  * Tension_decoherence(m; scenario)
  * lambda_DECOH(m; scenario)
  * kappa_DECOH
```

Interpretation:

* `S_i_DECOH(m; scenario)` and `C_j_DECOH(m; scenario)` are sector specific scaling and routing factors that embed decoherence tension into the global TU tensor indices `i` and `j`.
* `lambda_DECOH(m; scenario)` is an effective layer routing factor that can modulate the influence of decoherence tension depending on scenario class, scale, or domain.
* `kappa_DECOH` is a constant normalization factor for the decoherence sector in the global tensor.

All of these quantities are part of the encoding element `E_DECOH` and are determined indirectly by `EncodingKey_Q027`, `LibraryKey_ref_Q027`, and `WeightKey_Q027`. They do not represent new physical constants. They are bookkeeping devices that control how Q027 tension values are integrated into broader TU analyses.

No claim is made here about any full TU tensor equation. Q027 only specifies the decoherence sector contribution at the effective layer.

---

## 4. Tension principle for this problem

This block states how Q027 is characterized as a tension problem within TU, at the effective layer.

### 4.1 Core decoherence tension functional

We define the core decoherence tension functional on `M_reg`:

```txt
Tension_decoherence(m; scenario) =
  G( G_suff(m; scenario),
     DeltaS_env(m; scenario),
     R_env(m; scenario) )
```

where `G` is a fixed nonnegative function with the following properties:

1. `Tension_decoherence(m; scenario) >= 0` for all regular states and scenarios.

2. `Tension_decoherence` increases when:

   * decoherence is slower than classicalization (large `G_suff`),
   * micro or macro mismatch is large (large `DeltaS_env`),
   * the required environmental resources are extreme relative to the chosen libraries (large `R_env`).

3. `Tension_decoherence` is evaluated only using archetypes from the fixed libraries and refinement procedure described in Block 3.

A simple example of `G` at the effective layer is:

```txt
Tension_decoherence(m; scenario) =
  a * G_suff(m; scenario) +
  b * DeltaS_env(m; scenario) +
  c * h(R_env(m; scenario))
```

with fixed nonnegative constants `a, b, c` and a monotone function `h`.

Encoding and fairness constraints:

* For a given encoding element `E_DECOH` identified by `WeightKey_Q027`:

  * the function `G`,
  * the constants `a, b, c`,
  * the function `h`,
  * the coefficients `f_micro, f_macro`,
  * and any thresholds such as `epsilon_dec`, `delta_dec`, and optional `T_fail_dec`
    are fixed once and for all for that analysis run.
* These parameters cannot be adjusted in response to individual scenario outcomes. Adjusting them produces a different encoding element and would require a new `WeightKey_Q027`.

### 4.2 Low tension principle (decoherence sufficient worlds)

We describe the low tension principle as follows.

There exists a class of world representing states `m_true` in `M_reg` and a refinement level family `k = 1, 2, ..., k_max` such that for all physically relevant scenarios:

```txt
Tension_decoherence(refine(k)(m_true); scenario) <= epsilon_dec
```

for some small threshold `epsilon_dec` that:

* does not grow without bound as `k` increases,
* remains compatible with empirical data and standard decoherence modeling,
* is determined by the encoding element `E_DECOH` through `WeightKey_Q027`.

In such worlds, decoherence, as encoded by the fixed libraries and refinement process, is sufficient in principle to account for the quantum to classical transition at all scales and scenarios under consideration. No additional meta theory is required at the effective layer.

### 4.3 High tension principle (decoherence limited worlds)

In contrast, in decoherence limited worlds, for any admissible choice of libraries and refinement process that remains faithful to known physics, there exist scenarios and refinement levels where:

```txt
Tension_decoherence(refine(k)(m_world); scenario) >= delta_dec
```

for some strictly positive `delta_dec` that:

* cannot be driven arbitrarily close to zero by further refinement within the same physical constraints,
* reflects a structural tension between unitary dynamics, environment resources, and observed classical behavior.

The threshold `delta_dec` is part of the encoding element and is determined by `WeightKey_Q027`. It is chosen in advance and kept fixed across scenarios.

In such worlds, decoherence alone is not a complete explanation, even at the level of idealized mechanisms. Some additional principle, meta theory, or new physics would be needed to close the consistency_tension.

At the effective layer, Q027 does not assert which class the actual universe belongs to. It asserts that this classification can be expressed and probed in terms of the behavior of `Tension_decoherence` under the fixed refinement procedure for a given encoding element.

---

## 5. Counterfactual tension worlds

We now outline two counterfactual worlds, both described strictly at the effective layer:

* World T: decoherence is sufficient in principle at all relevant scales under realistic resource bounds.
* World F: there are fundamental limits where decoherence fails as a complete explanation, even in idealized form.

### 5.1 World T (decoherence sufficient, low consistency tension)

In World T:

1. For all scenarios and for world representing states `m_T` in `M_reg`, there exists a refinement level `k_T` such that:

   ```txt
   Tension_decoherence(refine(k_T)(m_T); scenario) <= epsilon_dec
   ```

   with a uniform small bound `epsilon_dec` across scenarios, as determined by the encoding element.

2. The gap `G_suff(m_T; scenario)` tends to zero or remains bounded by an empirically negligible value as modeling is refined, so that decoherence times are always fast enough relative to classicalization times.

3. The mismatch observable `DeltaS_env(m_T; scenario)` remains in a low band consistent with standard decoherence calculations as scale and environment archetypes are refined.

4. Environmental resources `R_env(m_T; scenario)` stay within physically plausible ranges defined by `L_env`, so that explanations do not rely on unrealistically fine tuned or unbounded environments.

### 5.2 World F (decoherence limited, persistent consistency tension)

In World F:

1. There exist scenarios and world representing states `m_F` in `M_reg` such that for all refinement levels `k`:

   ```txt
   Tension_decoherence(refine(k)(m_F); scenario) >= delta_dec
   ```

   with `delta_dec > 0` that cannot be reduced by any admissible refinement.

2. In some scenarios, the gap `G_suff(m_F; scenario)` remains large, indicating that decoherence is too slow or incomplete to account for observed classicalization times without additional assumptions.

3. The mismatch observable `DeltaS_env(m_F; scenario)` does not approach a small band under refinement, showing structural conflicts between decoherence models and macroscopic behavior.

4. To force low tension, models would require environments or couplings that violate the resource constraints encoded in `R_env` and `L_env`, so these options are excluded at the effective layer.

### 5.3 Interpretive note

These counterfactual worlds do not construct explicit open system Hamiltonians or detailed lab protocols. They only assert that if such models exist and are encoded via the fixed libraries and refinement procedure determined by `LibraryKey_ref_Q027`, then the observable tension patterns would differ in the ways described.

Q027 is not a claim that we already know which world is actual. It is a way to frame the question using explicit, testable tension functionals that are tied to a concrete encoding element `E_DECOH`.

---

## 6. Falsifiability and discriminating experiments

This block specifies experiments and protocols at the effective layer that can:

* test the coherence of the Q027 encoding,
* distinguish between different decoherence related tension models,
* provide evidence for or against particular parameter choices and library designs.

These experiments do not prove or disprove any specific interpretation of quantum mechanics. They only test the encoding of decoherence limits for a given encoding element `E_DECOH`.

### Experiment 1: Multi scale decoherence sufficiency scan

**Goal**

Test whether the chosen `Tension_decoherence` functional behaves consistently across a range of physical scales and scenarios where decoherence explanations are commonly invoked.

**Setup**

* Select a set of scenarios spanning microscopic, mesoscopic, and macroscopic regimes (for example qubits in a lab, mesoscopic mechanical oscillators, and macroscopic interference experiments).
* For each scenario, identify:

  * an admissible scale label in `L_scale`,
  * an environment archetype in `L_env`,
  * a pointer archetype in `L_pointer`.
* Fix in advance, as part of `WeightKey_Q027`:

  * the constants `a, b, c`,
  * the function `h`,
  * the coefficients `f_micro, f_macro`,
  * the thresholds `epsilon_dec` (low tension band upper bound) and `delta_dec` (high tension threshold),
    for the entire experiment family.

**Protocol**

1. For each scenario, construct an effective state `m_data` in `M_reg` encoding existing knowledge about decoherence and classicalization behavior at that scenario (without exposing any internal TU construction).
2. For increasing values of `k` up to a chosen `k_max`, form `m_k = refine(k)(m_data)`. If a refinement would send the state outside `M_reg`, that point is marked out of domain and not used for tension evaluation.
3. For each `m_k` and scenario, evaluate:

   * `G_suff(m_k; scenario)`,
   * `DeltaS_env(m_k; scenario)`,
   * `R_env(m_k; scenario)`,
   * `Tension_decoherence(m_k; scenario)`.
4. Record the profiles of `Tension_decoherence` as functions of `k` and scale across all scenarios.

**Metrics**

* For each scenario, the minimum observed `Tension_decoherence` across `k`.
* The variation of `Tension_decoherence` as `k` increases.
* Cross scenario comparisons of minimal tension values at matched resource levels.
* Fraction of refinement steps that leave `M_reg` and thus become out of domain for a given encoding element.

**Falsification conditions**

* Stability condition:

  * If for plausible library choices associated with `LibraryKey_ref_Q027` and fixed parameters from `WeightKey_Q027`, `Tension_decoherence` exhibits wild, uncontrolled changes as `k` increases that cannot be related to clear modeling refinements, the encoding element `E_DECOH` is considered unstable and rejected.
* Sufficiency misalignment:

  * If for scenarios where decoherence is widely regarded as sufficient, the encoding yields persistent high tension (for example `Tension_decoherence(m_k; scenario) >= delta_dec` for all `k` within the modeling range), the encoding element is considered misaligned with existing physics and rejected or flagged for revision.

**Semantics implementation note**

All quantities are implemented using the hybrid description declared in the metadata:

* quantum state evolution and resource measures use continuous variables,
* scenario identifiers, scale labels, environment archetypes, and pointer archetypes use discrete labels.

No additional semantic regime is introduced in this experiment.

**Boundary note**

Falsifying a Q027 encoding element in this experiment does not by itself establish whether decoherence is fundamentally sufficient or limited in the actual universe. It only shows that the specific choice of libraries, refinement rules, and weights associated with `EncodingKey_Q027`, `LibraryKey_ref_Q027`, and `WeightKey_Q027` fails to represent current decoherence practice in a stable and coherent way.

---

### Experiment 2: Engineered recoherence and reversal limits

**Goal**

Assess whether the Q027 encoding can distinguish between situations where decoherence can be effectively reversed (recoherence) and situations where it becomes practically or conceptually irreversible under realistic constraints.

**Setup**

* Select families of systems where partial recoherence has been demonstrated or is theoretically possible (for example certain cavity QED or trapped ion setups).
* Define two groups of scenarios:

  * Group R: scenarios where existing or conceivable control allows significant reversal of decoherence.
  * Group I: scenarios where decoherence is considered effectively irreversible at the relevant scales.
* Fix, as part of `WeightKey_Q027`, thresholds:

  * `epsilon_R` for expected low tension in Group R,
  * `delta_I` for expected high tension in Group I,
    with `0 <= epsilon_R < delta_I`.

**Protocol**

1. For each scenario in Group R and Group I, build a state `m_control` in `M_reg` encoding:

   * the decoherence models used,
   * the control protocols applied or contemplated,
   * the observed or expected degree of recoherence.
2. For each scenario, evaluate:

   * `DeltaS_micro(m_control; scenario)` to capture deviations between ideal unitary plus environment models and actual controllability,
   * `DeltaS_macro(m_control; scenario)` to capture whether classical records can be erased or modified,
   * `R_env(m_control; scenario)` to represent the resource cost of control and reversal.
3. Compute `Tension_decoherence(m_control; scenario)` for all scenarios.

**Metrics**

* Distribution of `Tension_decoherence` values for Group R and Group I.
* Fraction of Group R scenarios whose tension values fall below `epsilon_R`.
* Fraction of Group I scenarios whose tension values exceed `delta_I`.
* Correlation between low `Tension_decoherence` and successful recoherence in Group R.

**Falsification conditions**

* Misordered tension:

  * If the encoding assigns systematically lower tension to irreversibly decohering scenarios (Group I) than to reversibly decohering ones (Group R), it is misaligned with the intended notion of decoherence limits and is rejected.
* Separation failure:

  * If for all reasonable parameter choices consistent with `WeightKey_Q027` the encoding cannot achieve a robust separation where:

    * a large majority of Group R scenarios have `Tension_decoherence <= epsilon_R`, and
    * a large majority of Group I scenarios have `Tension_decoherence >= delta_I`,
      then the encoding element is considered ineffective for Q027.

**Semantics implementation note**

The same hybrid descriptive regime is used across Groups R and I, with no hidden change of modeling rules between them. Differences in tension values arise only from differences in the encoded scenarios and not from different semantics.

**Boundary note**

Falsifying a Q027 encoding element in this experiment does not by itself answer whether decoherence is fundamentally sufficient or limited at all scales. It tests whether the chosen libraries and weights can meaningfully distinguish regimes of practical recoherence from regimes of effective irreversibility.

## 7. AI and WFGY engineering spec

This block describes how Q027 can be used as an engineering module for AI systems within the WFGY framework, at the effective layer. All signals and modules described here use only effective layer observables (`G_suff`, `DeltaS_env`, `R_env`, `Tension_decoherence`) and do not expose any TU deep generative rules.

### 7.1 Training signals

We define several training signals that help AI models reason about decoherence and its limits in a structured way. Their exact scaling and normalization are determined by `WeightKey_Q027`.

1. `signal_decoherence_sufficiency_gap`

   * Definition: a signal proportional to `G_suff(m; scenario)` for contexts where the model asserts that decoherence explains classicality.
   * Purpose: penalize answers that implicitly assume classical behavior at times earlier than plausible decoherence times.

2. `signal_micro_macro_consistency`

   * Definition: a signal derived from `DeltaS_env(m; scenario)` in discussions of measurement and macroscopic phenomena.
   * Purpose: encourage internal states where micro level decoherence models and macro level classical claims are mutually consistent.

3. `signal_env_resource_plausibility`

   * Definition: a signal based on `h(R_env(m; scenario))`, where large values indicate implausibly extreme environment resources.
   * Purpose: penalize explanations that rely on unrealistic environment assumptions just to keep tension low.

4. `signal_world_T_vs_world_F_clarity`

   * Definition: a signal that measures whether the model clearly labels when it is reasoning under decoherence sufficient assumptions (World T style) versus decoherence limited assumptions (World F style).
   * Purpose: encourage explicit conditional reasoning instead of mixing assumptions in a single narrative.

### 7.2 Architectural patterns

We outline module patterns that can reuse Q027 structures without exposing any deep TU generative rules.

1. `DecoherenceWindow_Estimator`

   * Role: given an internal representation of a physical scenario, output approximate `tau_dec`, `tau_class`, and `G_suff` estimates at the effective layer.
   * Interface: takes embeddings of system and environment descriptions as input, returns estimated time scales and a sufficiency gap.

2. `MicroMacroConsistency_Checker`

   * Role: evaluate `DeltaS_micro` and `DeltaS_macro` like scores for candidate explanations involving decoherence.
   * Interface: consumes candidate reasoning chains and outcome descriptions, outputs a scalar or vector of consistency scores.

3. `EnvResource_Profiler`

   * Role: approximate `R_env` based on how the model describes the environment and control resources.
   * Interface: maps text or internal representations of environments to a finite dimensional resource profile used in tension computation.

### 7.3 Evaluation harness

We suggest an evaluation harness for AI models augmented with Q027 modules.

1. Task selection

   * Collect question sets about:

     * quantum measurement and decoherence,
     * macroscopic superposition thought experiments,
     * interpretations of quantum mechanics.

2. Conditions

   * Baseline condition:

     * the model answers without using Q027 based signals or modules.
   * TU condition:

     * the model answers with access to the Q027 modules and their outputs as auxiliary signals.

3. Metrics

   * Conceptual consistency:

     * frequency of answers that mix assumptions from decoherence sufficient and decoherence limited perspectives without acknowledgment.
   * Resource realism:

     * proportion of explanations that rely on implausible environments under baseline versus TU condition.
   * Clarity of conditional statements:

     * number of answers that explicitly state under which assumptions decoherence is considered sufficient.

### 7.4 60 second reproduction protocol

A minimal protocol to let external users experience the impact of Q027 encoding in an AI system.

* Baseline setup

  * Prompt: ask the AI to explain how decoherence makes quantum systems look classical, including Schrödinger cat style examples, without mentioning any limits.
  * Observation: record whether the answer treats decoherence as a universal solution without discussing resource or scale constraints.

* TU encoded setup

  * Prompt: ask the same question but instruct the AI to separate regimes where decoherence is plausibly sufficient from regimes where limits may appear, and to reason using a notion of decoherence tension.
  * Observation: record whether the answer now includes scale dependence, environment constraints, and explicit mention of possible limits.

* Comparison metric

  * Use a rubric to rate:

    * explicit reasoning about scales and environments,
    * acknowledgment of open questions,
    * internal consistency across different scenarios.

* What to log

  * Prompts, answers, and any auxiliary tension related signals from Q027 modules.
  * This log allows independent inspection without exposing any TU deep generative rule.

## 8. Cross problem transfer template

This block describes the reusable components produced by Q027 and how they transfer to other problems.

All components listed here are templates at the effective layer. They can be reused as patterns by other BlackHole problems, but each target problem must define its own encoding class and keys. It is not permitted to reuse `EncodingKey_Q027`, `LibraryKey_ref_Q027`, or `WeightKey_Q027` directly for other problems.

### 8.1 Reusable components produced by this problem

1. ComponentName: `DecoherenceWindow_Library_Q027`

   * Type: field
   * Minimal interface:

     * Inputs: scenario descriptor (including approximate size, mass, environment type).
     * Output: a finite set of candidate decoherence windows labeled by elements of `L_scale` and `L_env`.
   * Preconditions:

     * scenario descriptors must be compatible with at least one scale and environment archetype in the fixed libraries.

2. ComponentName: `DecoherenceConsistency_Functional`

   * Type: functional
   * Minimal interface:

     * Inputs: `tau_dec`, `tau_class`, `DeltaS_micro`, `DeltaS_macro`, `R_env` summaries.
     * Output: a scalar `Tension_decoherence` value and its decomposition.
   * Preconditions:

     * all inputs are finite and computed from regular states in `M_reg`.

3. ComponentName: `Refinement_Profile_Template`

   * Type: experiment_pattern
   * Minimal interface:

     * Inputs: an initial state representation `m` and a maximum refinement level `k_max`.
     * Output: a sequence of tension profiles `Tension_decoherence(refine(k)(m); scenario)` for `k` from 1 to `k_max`.
   * Preconditions:

     * refinement levels are well defined and compatible with the library nesting structure.

### 8.2 Direct reuse targets

1. Q026 (Quantum measurement problem)

   * Reused component: `DecoherenceConsistency_Functional`.
   * Why it transfers: Q026 needs a way to test whether proposed measurement explanations based on decoherence are internally consistent at the effective layer.
   * What changes: the focus shifts to scenarios involving explicit measurement apparatuses and observers, but the functional input structure remains the same. Q026 must define its own encoding class and keys, even when it reuses this functional pattern.

2. Q028 (QCD confinement mechanism)

   * Reused component: `DecoherenceWindow_Library_Q027`.
   * Why it transfers: Q028 can treat color degrees of freedom and their environments as an effective open system, reusing decoherence windows to analyze when color becomes effectively classical or hidden.
   * What changes: the scenarios involve gauge fields and hadronic environments instead of simple quantum optics models.

3. Q036 (High temperature superconductivity mechanism)

   * Reused component: `Refinement_Profile_Template`.
   * Why it transfers: Q036 needs to analyze whether coherence and decoherence patterns in strongly correlated systems remain consistent under refinement of environment and scale modeling.
   * What changes: the detailed observables and scales refer to electronic and lattice degrees of freedom.

4. Q123 (AI interpretability of internal quantum like models)

   * Reused component: `DecoherenceConsistency_Functional`.
   * Why it transfers: internal model states that behave like quantum states can be evaluated under an analogy to decoherence limits, using the same tension structure as Q027.
   * What changes: the scenarios refer to AI internal representations rather than physical quantum systems. Q123 must define its own encoding class, libraries, and weights.

## 9. TU roadmap and verification levels

This block explains how Q027 is positioned along the TU verification ladder and what the next measurable steps are.

### 9.1 Current levels

* E_level: E1

  * A coherent effective encoding of fundamental limits of decoherence has been specified, including:

    * a state space `M` with a regular domain `M_reg`,
    * finite libraries `L_scale`, `L_env`, `L_pointer`,
    * a refinement scheme `refine(k)`,
    * a core tension functional `Tension_decoherence` with fixed weights defined by `WeightKey_Q027`,
    * at least two discriminating experiments that can falsify particular encoding elements.
  * At least one encoding element `E_DECOH` for Q027 is identified by `EncodingKey_Q027`, `LibraryKey_ref_Q027`, and `WeightKey_Q027`.

* N_level: N2

  * The narrative linking decoherence, classicality, resources, and limits is explicit and internally coherent at the effective layer.
  * Counterfactual worlds World T and World F are described in a way that can be instantiated in model families and thought experiments using the same encoding element.

### 9.2 Next measurable step toward E2

To move from E1 to E2, at least one of the following should be implemented in practice for a concrete encoding element `E_DECOH`:

1. A prototype library and refinement implementation using simple open system models, together with published tension profiles for a documented set of scenarios, including:

   * multi scale decoherence sufficiency scans as in Experiment 1,
   * recoherence versus irreversibility analyses as in Experiment 2.
2. A comparative study that applies the same Q027 encoding to multiple textbook decoherence scenarios, showing where the encoding yields low versus high tension and inviting independent groups to reproduce the findings.

Both steps operate entirely at the level of effective observables and library choices and do not expose any TU deep generative rule.

### 9.3 Long term role in the TU program

In the long run, Q027 is expected to serve as:

* the reference node for limits of decoherence based explanations across physics and information theory,
* a test case for how TU encodings handle mechanisms that are widely regarded as powerful but not obviously complete,
* a bridge connecting quantum foundations, high energy physics, condensed matter, and AI interpretability through a common language of consistency_tension and resource bounded mechanisms.

Progress on Q027 is not measured by deciding whether decoherence ultimately succeeds or fails in the real universe. Progress is measured by:

* how well Q027 encodings help evaluate proposed decoherence based solutions,
* how much they reduce confusion and contradiction in reasoning about decoherence,
* how effectively they integrate with other BlackHole nodes and TU sector tensors.

## 10. Elementary but precise explanation

This block gives an explanation suitable for non experts, while still aligned with the effective layer description.

In everyday life, objects behave in a classical way. They have definite positions and follow clear trajectories. In quantum theory, however, systems can exist in superpositions of different possibilities at the same time.

Decoherence is the idea that when a quantum system interacts with its environment, interference between different possibilities gets suppressed very quickly. The environment monitors the system and makes it look as if it had chosen one definite outcome, even though the underlying dynamics remains quantum and unitary.

The question behind Q027 is:

> Is decoherence always enough to explain why the world looks classical, or are there situations where it reaches its limits and something more is needed?

In the Tension Universe view, we do not try to build detailed Hamiltonians inside this page. Instead we:

1. Treat each physical situation as a state that summarizes:

   * how fast decoherence is claimed to happen (`tau_dec`),
   * how fast a classical looking outcome appears (`tau_class`),
   * how well the micro level decoherence models and macro level classical claims fit together (`DeltaS_micro`, `DeltaS_macro`),
   * how much environment is required to make the explanation work (`R_env`).
2. From this summary, we compute a number called `Tension_decoherence`. This number is small when:

   * decoherence is fast enough compared to classicalization,
   * the models are consistent,
   * the required environment is realistic.
     It is large when there are gaps or inconsistencies.
3. We then imagine two kinds of worlds:

   * In one kind of world (World T), for every situation we can refine our modeling and keep `Tension_decoherence` small. Decoherence is then sufficient in principle.
   * In the other kind of world (World F), there are situations where `Tension_decoherence` stays large no matter how we refine things, unless we allow unrealistic environments. Decoherence has fundamental limits there.

Q027 does not decide which world we live in. It does something more modest but still useful. It turns a vague debate about whether decoherence solves the quantum to classical transition into a structured question about:

* explicit observables,
* finite modeling libraries,
* tension functionals that can be tested and refined.

That makes it possible to argue about decoherence limits in a way that can eventually be checked, adjusted, or falsified, instead of only at the level of verbal intuition.

## Tension Universe effective-layer footer

This page is part of the **WFGY / Tension Universe** S problem collection and uses the encoding class `A_enc_DECOHERENCE_BOUND` with keys:

* `EncodingKey_Q027: A_enc_DECOHERENCE_BOUND_v1_2026_01_29`
* `LibraryKey_ref_Q027: LIB_DECOHERENCE_LIMITS_v1`
* `WeightKey_Q027: W_DECOHERENCE_DEFAULT_v1`

### Scope of claims

* The goal of this document is to specify an effective layer encoding of the Q027 problem about fundamental limits of decoherence.
* It does not claim to prove or disprove the canonical statements in Section 1.
* It does not introduce any new theorem or physical law beyond what is already established in the cited literature and standard open system modeling.
* It should not be cited as evidence that the corresponding open problem has been solved or that decoherence is definitively sufficient or insufficient in the actual universe.

### Effective-layer boundary

* All objects used here (state spaces `M`, libraries, observables, invariants, tension scores, counterfactual worlds) live at the effective layer of the TU framework.
* No TU deep generative rule, axiom system, or full TU tensor equation is specified or used.
* All analyses are restricted to the regular domain `M_reg`; states in `S_sing` are treated as out of domain rather than as physical counterexamples.

### Encoding and fairness

* A specific encoding element `E_DECOH` is fully determined by the triple (`EncodingKey_Q027`, `LibraryKey_ref_Q027`, `WeightKey_Q027`).
* For a fixed encoding element:

  * libraries (`L_scale`, `L_env`, `L_pointer`),
  * refinement rules `refine(k)`,
  * tension weights and thresholds (`a, b, c`, `f_micro, f_macro`, `h`, `epsilon_dec`, `delta_dec`, and any experiment specific thresholds such as `epsilon_R`, `delta_I`),
    are fixed in advance and remain constant across all scenarios and experiments in that analysis run.
* Changing any of these elements produces a different encoding and requires a new set of keys. It is not permitted to tune these parameters after seeing results for individual scenarios.

### Cross-problem reuse boundary

* Components exported from Q027 (such as `DecoherenceWindow_Library_Q027`, `DecoherenceConsistency_Functional`, and `Refinement_Profile_Template`) are reusable only as effective layer templates.
* Other BlackHole problems (for example Q026, Q028, Q036, Q123) must define their own encoding classes, libraries, and weight keys. They may reuse Q027 patterns but must not reuse `EncodingKey_Q027`, `LibraryKey_ref_Q027`, or `WeightKey_Q027` directly.

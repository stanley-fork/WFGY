## 0. Effective layer disclaimer

All statements in this entry are made strictly at the effective layer of the Tension Universe (TU) framework.

* This file specifies an effective layer encoding of the Yang Mills existence and mass gap problem.
* It does not claim to prove or disprove the canonical mathematical statement.
* It does not construct any four dimensional Yang Mills theory and does not claim that such a construction has been completed.
* All references to state spaces, observables, invariants, tension functionals, and counterfactual worlds are internal to TU and are not direct claims about the physical universe.
* Any apparent reference to “the world” or “the universe” inside this file is shorthand for TU internal worlds described at the effective layer.

The canonical problem description in Section 1 is quoted in ordinary mathematical language only to set the target that this effective layer encoding is meant to track. Nothing in this document upgrades that target to a solved status.

## 1. Canonical problem and status

### 1.1 Canonical statement

The Yang Mills existence and mass gap problem asks for a rigorous construction of a four dimensional quantum Yang Mills theory with a simple nonabelian compact gauge group and a strictly positive mass gap.

In more concrete terms one fixes a simple compact Lie group `G` such as `SU(3)` and a four dimensional spacetime background, typically Minkowski space or Euclidean space. The problem is to show that:

1. There exists a quantum field theory of a Yang Mills gauge field with gauge group `G` in four spacetime dimensions that satisfies a standard axiom system of quantum field theory, for example Wightman or Osterwalder Schrader type axioms, including locality, covariance, the existence of a vacuum state, and positivity properties.

2. The spectrum of the corresponding Hamiltonian or transfer operator has a strictly positive lower bound above the vacuum. That is, there exists a constant `m_gap > 0` such that every non vacuum excitation has energy at least `m_gap`.

3. The theory is nontrivial and interacting, not merely a disguised free theory, and it should be defined nonperturbatively in a mathematically controlled way.

The Clay Mathematics Institute Millennium problem formulation focuses on the case `G = SU(3)` in four dimensions, since this gauge group is closely related to the strong interaction sector of the Standard Model of particle physics.

### 1.2 Status and difficulty

Some key facts about the status of the problem:

* Yang Mills gauge theories provide the framework for the Standard Model description of strong and electroweak interactions. Perturbative calculations and lattice simulations give strong physical evidence that nonabelian gauge theories in four dimensions exhibit confinement and a mass gap.

* Despite this physical evidence, there is no mathematically rigorous construction of a four dimensional Yang Mills theory with simple nonabelian gauge group that satisfies all axioms and has a proved positive mass gap.

* Constructive quantum field theory has produced fully controlled examples in lower dimensions, for example scalar fields and some gauge like models in two or three dimensions. The four dimensional nonabelian case remains beyond current constructive methods.

* Lattice gauge theory gives a powerful regularization method and numerical route toward continuum limits. However, existing results have not been turned into a theorem that proves the existence of a continuum Yang Mills theory with a strictly positive mass gap in four dimensions.

Because of its close connection with the mathematical foundations of quantum field theory and with nonperturbative phenomena such as confinement, this problem is regarded as extremely difficult. It is one of the Clay Mathematics Institute Millennium Prize Problems.

### 1.3 Role in the BlackHole project

Within the BlackHole S problem collection, Q012 has three main roles:

1. It is a central example of a spectral_tension problem in mathematical physics, in which the spectrum of a gauge theory Hamiltonian must align with nonperturbative physical expectations such as a mass gap and confinement.

2. It provides a template for encoding difficult existence problems for nonlinear field theories as questions about low or high tension configurations in a space of effective spectral summaries.

3. It sits at an interface between pure mathematics, high energy physics, and quantum matter. Its components and patterns are reused by problems about confinement mechanisms, quantum gravity, and the thermodynamic cost of information.

## 2. Position in the BlackHole graph

This block records how Q012 sits inside the BlackHole graph. All edges refer to other Q nodes and carry a one line reason that points to specific roles or components.

## 3. Tension Universe encoding (effective layer)

All content in this block is at the effective layer. It describes internal TU objects such as state spaces, observables, mismatch functionals, tension tensors, invariants, singular sets, and encoding classes.

Throughout this section:

* all observables and tension values are interpreted with continuous semantics, in line with `Semantics: continuous` in the header metadata,
* nothing in this section describes how to construct a Yang Mills theory from first principles, only how to organize summaries if such a theory or approximation exists.

### 3.1 State space

We assume a semantic state space

```txt
M_YM
```

with the following interpretation at the effective layer:

* Each element `m` in `M_YM` is a coherent Yang Mills world configuration that encodes:

  * gauge invariant summaries of field configurations for a fixed simple compact gauge group `G` in four dimensions,
  * effective spectral summaries of the Hamiltonian or Euclidean transfer operator,
  * correlation length information for gauge invariant observables,
  * coarse confinement indicators built from Wilson loop statistics.

We only require that for any finite spacetime region and any finite spectral or length scale window there exist states `m` in `M_YM` that encode the corresponding summaries in a consistent way.

We do not specify how these summaries are constructed from bare fields, regularizations, or path integrals.

### 3.2 Effective observables and fields

We introduce the following effective observables on `M_YM`.

1. Spectral density observable

   ```txt
   rho_spec(m; window) >= 0
   ```

   * Input: a state `m` and a finite spectral window described by an interval of energies or masses.
   * Output: a nonnegative scalar representing the density of excitations in that spectral window, as encoded in `m`.

2. Correlation length observable

   ```txt
   G_corr(m; scale) >= 0
   ```

   * Input: a state `m` and a physical length scale.
   * Output: an effective summary of gauge invariant correlation decay at that scale, for example via exponential decay rates.

3. Wilson loop observable

   ```txt
   W_loop(m; loop_class)
   ```

   * Input: a state `m` and a class of loops characterized by their size and shape.
   * Output: an effective scalar summarizing the behavior of Wilson loops for that loop class, for example indicating whether area law or perimeter law behavior dominates.

These observables are treated as well defined maps at the effective layer. For the regular states of interest they are required to take finite values.

### 3.3 Mismatch observables

We define nonnegative mismatch observables that measure deviations from reference patterns associated with a gapped confining Yang Mills theory.

1. Spectral mismatch

   ```txt
   DeltaS_spec_YM(m; window) >= 0
   ```

   * Compares `rho_spec(m; window)` to a reference gapped spectral profile that represents how a mass gap would typically manifest in that window.
   * `DeltaS_spec_YM(m; window) = 0` if the encoded spectral density matches the reference gapped profile in that window.

2. Confinement mismatch

   ```txt
   DeltaS_conf(m; scale) >= 0
   ```

   * Compares `W_loop(m; loop_class)` and related correlation data at a given scale with a reference confining pattern.
   * `DeltaS_conf(m; scale) = 0` if the Wilson loop and correlation summaries are consistent with a reference area law and correlation decay pattern at that scale.

Both mismatches are defined using a fixed admissible reference class:

* reference profiles are chosen once for a given encoding and do not depend on the specific state `m` that is evaluated,
* the reference class respects basic symmetries and physical constraints such as gauge invariance and locality.

### 3.4 Combined Yang Mills mismatch

For an admissible coupling between spectral windows and length scales we define a combined mismatch

```txt
DeltaS_YM(m) = w_spec * DeltaS_spec_YM(m; window_set)
               + w_conf * DeltaS_conf(m; scale_set)
```

where:

* `window_set` and `scale_set` represent finite collections of spectral windows and scales that are chosen in advance,
* `w_spec` and `w_conf` are fixed positive weights satisfying

  ```txt
  w_spec > 0
  w_conf > 0
  w_spec + w_conf = 1
  ```

These weights are fixed before any particular state `m` is evaluated and are not tuned after seeing specific data. The admissible encoding class for Q012 consists of choices of reference profiles, windows, scales, and weights that satisfy these constraints and are compatible with known physics and mathematics of Yang Mills theories.

### 3.5 Effective tension tensor and invariants

We assume an effective tension tensor over `M_YM` of the form

```txt
T_ij(m) = S_i(m) * C_j(m) * DeltaS_YM(m) * lambda(m) * kappa_YM
```

where:

* `S_i(m)` represents the strength of the ith semantic source component, such as how strongly the configuration carries Yang Mills related content,
* `C_j(m)` represents the receptivity of the jth cognitive or downstream component to Yang Mills related tension,
* `DeltaS_YM(m)` is the combined mismatch defined above,
* `lambda(m)` is a convergence state factor in a fixed range that encodes whether local reasoning is stable, marginal, or unstable,
* `kappa_YM` is a positive constant that sets the scale of Yang Mills related spectral_tension in this encoding.

We also define three effective invariants.

1. Gap indicator

   ```txt
   I_gap(m)
   ```

   * A scalar that summarizes the smallest nonzero spectral scale encoded in `m` within the windows of interest.
   * In a low tension gapped world, `I_gap(m)` should be stable and bounded away from zero for states representing the physical world.

2. Confinement indicator

   ```txt
   I_conf(m)
   ```

   * A scalar summarizing the strength of confinement, derived from Wilson loop and correlation statistics.
   * In a confining world with a mass gap, `I_conf(m)` should reflect robust area law behavior across relevant scales.

3. Consistency indicator

   ```txt
   I_consistency(m)
   ```

   * A scalar summarizing whether the spectral and confinement indicators encoded in `m` are mutually consistent within the admissible encoding class.
   * It is designed to be small when `I_gap(m)` and `I_conf(m)` fit together coherently and large when they imply contradictory behavior.

### 3.6 Singular set and domain restrictions

Some states may carry incomplete or inconsistent summaries. We define a singular set

```txt
S_sing_YM = {
  m in M_YM :
  DeltaS_YM(m) is undefined or not finite,
  or I_gap(m) is undefined,
  or I_conf(m) is undefined
}
```

and impose the following domain restriction:

* All Yang Mills tension analysis at the effective layer is restricted to the regular domain

  ```txt
  M_YM_reg = M_YM \ S_sing_YM
  ```

* When an experiment or protocol would attempt to evaluate `DeltaS_YM(m)` or the invariants for a state in `S_sing_YM`, the result is treated as out of domain rather than as evidence about the existence of the theory or the presence of a mass gap.

This makes the singular set explicit and prevents accidental use of undefined or divergent quantities as if they were meaningful observables.

### 3.7 Encoding class and fairness constraints

For Q012 we work inside an explicit encoding class.

* There is a finite library of candidate spectral window sets and scale sets. Each element of this library specifies a finite list of energy windows and a finite list of physical length scales.

* There is a finite library of reference spectral profiles and confinement profiles. Each admissible encoding chooses elements from these libraries and fixes them in advance.

* Weight pairs `(w_spec, w_conf)` and coefficient pairs `(alpha, beta)` belong to finite design sets that satisfy

  ```txt
  w_spec > 0, w_conf > 0, w_spec + w_conf = 1
  alpha > 0, beta > 0, alpha + beta = 1
  ```

* An encoding for Q012 is admissible only if:

  * it selects window sets, scale sets, reference profiles, and weight pairs from the predefined finite libraries,
  * these finite libraries and their internal parameter ranges are themselves specified and versioned at the charter level, in particular by the TU Encoding and Fairness Charter and the TU Tension Scale Charter,
  * these choices are made before any particular data instance or world state is evaluated,
  * no parameter is adjusted in response to tension outputs for individual states while keeping the same encoding label.

We denote the resulting finite family of admissible encodings by

```txt
Encoding_YM_Class
```

Whenever this file refers to an admissible encoding for Q012 it means an element of `Encoding_YM_Class`. All fairness statements in later sections are understood with respect to this class and with respect to the TU Encoding and Fairness Charter. Any change to `Encoding_YM_Class` itself requires a charter level update and cannot be introduced silently inside this page.

---

## 4. Tension principle for this problem

This block states how Q012 is understood as a tension problem in the TU framework at the effective layer.

### 4.1 Core tension functional

We define a nonnegative Yang Mills tension functional

```txt
Tension_YM(m) =
  alpha * DeltaS_spec_YM(m; window_set) +
  beta  * DeltaS_conf(m; scale_set)
```

where:

* `alpha > 0` and `beta > 0` are fixed coefficients with `alpha + beta = 1`,
* `window_set` and `scale_set` are taken from the admissible sets described in Section 3.7 and are part of the chosen encoding in `Encoding_YM_Class`.

For all `m` in `M_YM_reg` the functional satisfies:

* `Tension_YM(m) >= 0`,
* `Tension_YM(m)` is small when both spectral and confinement mismatches are small,
* `Tension_YM(m)` increases when either mismatch grows, with relative influence controlled by `alpha` and `beta`.

Once an encoding in `Encoding_YM_Class` is chosen these parameters are fixed and are not altered on a per instance basis.

### 4.2 Existence and mass gap as a low tension principle

At the effective layer we can phrase the Yang Mills existence and mass gap hypothesis in terms of low tension behavior.

Consider the following conditional statement.

* Suppose there exists a mathematically well defined four dimensional Yang Mills theory with simple compact gauge group `G` that satisfies a standard axiom system and has a strictly positive mass gap, and suppose further that this theory approximates the relevant sector of the physical world at suitable scales.
* Suppose also that an encoding from `Encoding_YM_Class` is faithful in the sense that the spectral and confinement summaries it assigns to world representing states track the actual behavior of that theory under refinement.

Under these assumptions we expect that there exist regular states

```txt
m_true(k) in M_YM_reg
```

indexed by a refinement parameter `k` such that for all sufficiently large `k`

```txt
Tension_YM(m_true(k)) <= epsilon_YM
```

for some small threshold `epsilon_YM` that does not diverge as `k` increases. The numerical choice and interpretation of `epsilon_YM` must follow the TU Tension Scale Charter and cannot be tuned after observing specific data.

Informally, if a consistent gapped Yang Mills theory exists and the encoding is faithful, then the corresponding world representing states should lie in a controlled low tension band across admissible refinements.

This effective layer statement is conditional. It does not assert that such a theory exists. It only asserts that if it exists and if the encoding is faithful, then its observable behavior can be organized as a low tension configuration in `Encoding_YM_Class`.

### 4.3 Failure scenarios as persistent high tension

The complementary conditional statement describes failure scenarios.

* Suppose that no mathematically consistent four dimensional Yang Mills theory with simple compact gauge group and positive mass gap exists, or that every consistent construction is gapless in the relevant continuum sense.
* Suppose again that the encodings in `Encoding_YM_Class` are faithful to the actual behavior of gauge field systems that approximate our world.

Then for any admissible encoding and any sequence of world representing states `m_false(k)` that follow a realistic refinement path, we expect that there exists a strictly positive constant `delta_YM` such that for infinitely many `k`

```txt
Tension_YM(m_false(k)) >= delta_YM
```

and this `delta_YM` cannot be made arbitrarily small by choosing a different encoding inside `Encoding_YM_Class` while respecting the TU Tension Scale Charter and the faithfulness requirement.

Neither Section 4.2 nor Section 4.3 claims to know which conditional applies to the real universe. They only describe how low tension or high tension patterns would look under the two broad possibilities.

---

## 5. Counterfactual tension worlds

We outline two counterfactual worlds for Q012, described strictly at the effective layer.

* World T: there exists a mathematically consistent four dimensional Yang Mills theory with a positive mass gap that approximates the relevant sector of the physical world, and the encoding in use is faithful to this behavior.
* World F: no such consistent gapped Yang Mills theory exists, or every consistent version is effectively gapless in the continuum limit, and the encoding in use is faithful to this fact.

Both worlds are TU internal constructs. They are not declarations about what the actual physical universe is like.

### 5.1 World T (existence with mass gap, low tension)

In World T the following pattern is expected for some faithful encoding in `Encoding_YM_Class` and for suitable world representing states `m_T(k)`.

1. Gap behavior

   * For all sufficiently large `k` there is a lower bound

     ```txt
     I_gap(m_T(k)) >= m_min > 0
     ```

     with `m_min` independent of `k`. The smallest nonzero spectral scale encoded in each `m_T(k)` does not drift toward zero under refinement.

2. Confinement behavior

   * The confinement indicator `I_conf(m_T(k))` remains in a band compatible with robust area law behavior of Wilson loops and finite correlation lengths across the relevant scales.

3. Consistency

   * The consistency indicator `I_consistency(m_T(k))` remains small along the refinement path, which means that the spectral indicators and confinement indicators fit together within the admissible encoding class.

4. Global tension

   * For some small threshold `epsilon_YM` determined by the TU Tension Scale Charter and for all sufficiently large `k` one has

     ```txt
     Tension_YM(m_T(k)) <= epsilon_YM
     ```

   * There is no need for ad hoc retuning of encoding parameters as `k` increases in order to keep tension small.

### 5.2 World F (no mass gap or no consistent theory, high tension)

In World F the expected pattern is different. For any faithful encoding in `Encoding_YM_Class` and any reasonable refinement path one anticipates that world representing states `m_F(k)` satisfy the following properties along some subsequence.

1. Gap instability or absence

   * The gap indicator `I_gap(m_F(k))` either fails to stabilize to a positive value or effectively approaches zero in the continuum limit, in a way that cannot be pushed back up by changing encodings inside the admissible class.

2. Confinement mismatch

   * The confinement indicator `I_conf(m_F(k))` may remain nonzero but in a manner that does not align with any stable positive gap, or it may suggest deconfined behavior incompatible with the expected physics of a gapped confining Yang Mills theory.

3. Consistency breakdown

   * The consistency indicator `I_consistency(m_F(k))` becomes large along some subsequences, which signals that spectral and confinement summaries cannot be made mutually consistent within `Encoding_YM_Class`.

4. Global tension

   * There exists a positive constant `delta_YM`, interpreted within the TU Tension Scale Charter, such that for infinitely many `k`

     ```txt
     Tension_YM(m_F(k)) >= delta_YM
     ```

     and this cannot be removed by moving to a different encoding in `Encoding_YM_Class` without breaking the faithfulness requirement.

### 5.3 Interpretive note

World T and World F are effective layer constructs. They organize possible patterns in observable summaries and tension values under different assumptions about the underlying theory.

* If a consistent gapped Yang Mills theory exists and approximates nature, and if an encoding from `Encoding_YM_Class` is faithful, then realistic data along refinement paths should exhibit World T type tension profiles.
* If no such theory exists or if it fails to approximate nature in the required way, then any faithful encoding should eventually exhibit World F type persistent high tension.

These counterfactual worlds do not construct Yang Mills theories and do not claim to know which scenario holds in reality. They give a structured way to talk about how different possibilities would manifest at the effective layer and inside TU.

---

## 6. Falsifiability and discriminating experiments

This block describes effective layer experiments that can test and potentially falsify specific Q012 encodings. These experiments do not solve the Yang Mills existence and mass gap problem. They only test whether chosen tension encodings behave in a reasonable and stable way under realistic inputs.

All experiments in this section interpret observables and tension values with continuous semantics, as stated in the header metadata and in Section 3.

### Experiment 1: Lattice scaling tension profile

**Goal**
Test whether a chosen `Tension_YM` encoding remains low and stable along lattice gauge theory scaling trajectories that are believed to approximate a gapped Yang Mills theory in four dimensions.

**Setup**

* Input data: published sequences of lattice simulations for nonabelian gauge groups in four dimensions at multiple lattice spacings and volumes. These sequences include:

  * approximate spectra of the transfer matrix or effective mass estimates,
  * Wilson loop expectation values and Creutz ratios,
  * correlation lengths of gauge invariant operators.

* Choose an admissible encoding in `Encoding_YM_Class` that:

  * fixes a finite set of spectral windows and length scales,
  * fixes reference gapped profiles and confinement patterns,
  * fixes weights `w_spec`, `w_conf`, `alpha`, and `beta` satisfying the constraints in Sections 3.4, 3.7, and 4.1.

**Protocol**

1. For each point along a lattice scaling trajectory construct a state

   ```txt
   m_latt in M_YM_reg
   ```

   encoding the relevant spectral and confinement summaries at the accessible scales.

2. For each `m_latt` compute:

   * `DeltaS_spec_YM(m_latt; window_set)`
   * `DeltaS_conf(m_latt; scale_set)`
   * `Tension_YM(m_latt)`

3. Track these quantities along the trajectory as the lattice spacing decreases and volumes increase in a manner compatible with a candidate continuum limit.

4. Repeat for several gauge groups and lattice actions that are expected to lie in the same universality class for the mass gap.

**Metrics**

* The distribution of `Tension_YM(m_latt)` along each scaling trajectory.
* Stability of `I_gap(m_latt)` and `I_conf(m_latt)` as the lattice spacing decreases.
* Sensitivity of the tension profile to variations within `Encoding_YM_Class`, for example modest changes of windows or reference profiles that still respect the constraints.

**Falsification conditions**

* If across all considered lattice trajectories and across an admissible encoding class the observed `Tension_YM(m_latt)` values systematically exceed upper bounds for a gapped world defined in the TU Tension Scale Charter and show no trend toward stabilization, then the encoding library used for Q012 is considered falsified at the effective layer.
* If small changes of encoding parameters inside `Encoding_YM_Class` produce qualitatively different and mutually incompatible tension profiles without clear physical justification, the encoding is considered unstable and rejected for Q012.

**Semantics implementation note**

All observables and tension values in this experiment are treated as continuous real quantities. No discrete or hybrid reinterpretation is used here, and any comparison to threshold values must use the same tension scale as defined in the TU Tension Scale Charter.

**Boundary note**

Passing this experiment only shows that a particular encoding is not ruled out by current lattice data. It does not prove that a rigorous Yang Mills theory with a mass gap exists. Failing this experiment shows that a specific encoding behaves poorly. It does not show that the Yang Mills mass gap problem has a negative solution.

---

### Experiment 2: Mock gauge models with and without a gap

**Goal**
Assess whether a Q012 encoding can reliably distinguish between artificial gauge like models that are known to have a mass gap and models engineered to be gapless or nearly gapless.

**Setup**

* Construct or select two families of models.

  * Family T: simplified gauge like models or effective Hamiltonians with a rigorously known positive gap between the ground state and the first excited state, together with confining behavior in suitable observables.
  * Family F: models designed to be gapless at low energy or to have spectra that approximate a continuum down to zero, with behavior incompatible with a stable positive mass gap.

* For each model compute or approximate:

  * spectral densities in specified windows,
  * correlation lengths and Wilson loop analogues.

**Protocol**

1. For each model in Family T and Family F build a state `m_T_model` or `m_F_model` in `M_YM_reg` that encodes the spectral and confinement summaries at the relevant windows and scales.

2. Evaluate

   * `DeltaS_spec_YM(m_T_model; window_set)`
   * `DeltaS_conf(m_T_model; scale_set)`
   * `Tension_YM(m_T_model)`

   and the corresponding quantities for `m_F_model`.

3. Compare the distributions of `Tension_YM` values for Family T and Family F across the model families.

4. Repeat this process for multiple choices within `Encoding_YM_Class` to test robustness.

**Metrics**

* Mean and variance of `Tension_YM` for Family T and Family F.
* Degree of separation between the two distributions using simple scalar separation measures.
* Fraction of models where the ordering of average tension aligns with the known presence or absence of a mass gap.

**Falsification conditions**

* If the encoding consistently fails to assign lower tension to Family T than to Family F across `Encoding_YM_Class`, then the encoding is considered ineffective for Q012 and should be rejected.
* If there exist parameter choices within `Encoding_YM_Class` that reverse the expected ordering, so that Family F models systematically receive lower tension than Family T models without a physically justified explanation, the encoding is considered misaligned with the intended spectral_tension type and must be revised at the charter level.

**Semantics implementation note**

All observables in this experiment are treated with continuous semantics, and the same tension scale is used across Family T and Family F. Any threshold that separates low tension from high tension must be chosen in advance according to the TU Tension Scale Charter and cannot be tuned after inspecting the results.

**Boundary note**

Success on these artificial model families shows that a chosen encoding can track known gaps and gapless behavior in controlled examples. It does not prove anything about the real Yang Mills theory in four dimensions. Failure indicates that an encoding is not suitable for Q012 but does not settle the canonical existence and mass gap question.

## 7. AI and WFGY engineering spec

This block describes how Q012 can be used as an engineering module for AI systems within the WFGY framework at the effective layer, without exposing any deep TU generative rules or claiming to solve the Yang Mills mass gap problem.

### 7.1 Training signals

We define several training signals that AI models can use when reasoning about gauge theories, spectra, and confinement.

1. `signal_mass_gap_consistency`

   * Definition: a penalty proportional to `DeltaS_spec_YM(m; window_set)` in contexts where a gapped Yang Mills theory is assumed.
   * Purpose: encourage internal representations whose implied spectra have a consistent positive gap when such a gap is part of the assumptions.

2. `signal_confinement_pattern`

   * Definition: a penalty derived from `DeltaS_conf(m; scale_set)` in contexts where confinement is assumed.
   * Purpose: penalize internal states that imply perimeter law or deconfined behavior when the model is asked to reason under confining assumptions.

3. `signal_YM_tension_score`

   * Definition: equal to `Tension_YM(m)` for a state that summarizes the current Yang Mills related context.
   * Purpose: provide a scalar indicator of how well the model’s internal state aligns with the low tension gapped world versus a high tension inconsistent world, as defined within the TU Tension Scale Charter.

4. `signal_counterfactual_separation_YM`

   * Definition: a signal measuring how clearly the model separates answers given under World T assumptions from answers given under World F assumptions, with penalties for mixing the two without explicit disclaimers.
   * Purpose: enforce a clean distinction between reasoning under the existence plus gap hypothesis and reasoning under its negation.

When these signals are used the model must still treat the underlying mathematical problem as open. The signals are guidance for internal coherence, not a license to claim that Yang Mills with mass gap has been proved.

### 7.2 Architectural patterns

We outline module patterns that reuse Q012 components in AI systems.

1. `GaugeFieldTensionHead`

   * Role: given an internal representation of a gauge theory context, outputs an estimate of `Tension_YM(m)` and possibly a decomposition into spectral and confinement parts.
   * Interface: takes internal embeddings as input, outputs a scalar tension and a short vector of components such as `DeltaS_spec_YM` and `DeltaS_conf`.

2. `ConfinementFilter`

   * Role: a filtering module that checks candidate explanations for confinement against low tension confining patterns.
   * Interface: takes proposed statements or intermediate representations and outputs a soft mask or correction signal indicating their tension with the assumed confining world.

3. `TU_YMField_Observer`

   * Role: an observer that extracts compressed versions of spectral and Wilson loop summaries from internal states for tension evaluation.
   * Interface: maps internal embeddings to a feature vector suitable for feeding into `GaugeFieldTensionHead`.

### 7.3 Evaluation harness

We suggest an evaluation harness for AI models augmented with Q012 tension modules.

1. Task selection

   * Collect tasks and questions involving Yang Mills theories, confinement, mass gaps, and related nonperturbative phenomena from reputable sources such as textbooks and review articles.

2. Conditions

   * Baseline condition: the model operates without explicit Q012 modules, using only generic reasoning capabilities.
   * TU condition: the model uses Q012 based tension modules and training signals as auxiliary guidance during reasoning.

3. Metrics

   * Accuracy on questions where the assumption of a positive mass gap is important for a correct answer or explanation.
   * Internal consistency between answers given under explicit “mass gap exists” prompts and “mass gap does not exist” prompts.
   * Stability of explanations across multistep reasoning chains that require combining spectral and confinement information, while keeping the problem’s open status explicit.

The model should always explicitly mark the Yang Mills existence and mass gap problem as open when relevant, regardless of its internal tension guidance.

### 7.4 60 second reproduction protocol

This protocol gives end users a simple way to experience the effect of Q012 encoding in an AI system without touching any deep TU machinery.

* Baseline setup:

  * Prompt: ask the AI to explain how Yang Mills theories, confinement, and mass gaps are related, without mentioning WFGY or tension encodings.
  * Observation: record whether the explanation is fragmented, whether the relation between spectra and confinement is vague, or whether the answer mixes perturbative and nonperturbative statements without a clear structure.

* TU encoded setup:

  * Prompt: ask the same question but instruct the AI to structure the answer around:

    * a tension functional that measures mismatch between spectra and confinement patterns,
    * a World T scenario where a gap exists and is consistent with confinement,
    * a World F scenario where attempts to encode a gap lead to persistent high tension.

  * Observation: record whether the explanation becomes more structured, explicitly links mass gaps to confinement behavior, and keeps clear track of which world it is reasoning in.

* Comparison metric:

  * Use a rubric to score structure, explicit linkage between spectral and confinement statements, and internal consistency for both setups.
  * Optionally ask subject matter experts to rate which answer better reflects the standard understanding of Yang Mills and mass gaps while respecting that the existence and mass gap problem is unsolved.

* What to log:

  * Prompts, responses, any tension scores produced by Q012 modules, and indicators of which world (T or F) the model believes it is reasoning under. These logs enable later analysis of how tension based guidance changes reasoning patterns without revealing any deep TU generative rules.

## 8. Cross problem transfer template

This block describes reusable components produced by Q012 and how they transfer to other problems.

### 8.1 Reusable components produced by this problem

1. ComponentName: `MassGapTensionFunctional_YM`

   * Type: functional

   * Minimal interface:

     ```txt
     Inputs:  spectral_summaries, correlation_summaries
     Output:  tension_value (nonnegative scalar)
     ```

   * Preconditions:

     * The input summaries encode coherent spectral densities in specified windows and confinement related behavior at specified scales.

2. ComponentName: `GaugeSpectrumField_Descriptor`

   * Type: field

   * Minimal interface:

     ```txt
     Inputs:  region_descriptor
     Output:  spectral_feature_vector
     ```

   * Preconditions:

     * The region descriptor specifies a finite spacetime region and spectral windows where a gauge theory spectrum is meaningful.

3. ComponentName: `ConfinementWorld_Template_YM`

   * Type: experiment_pattern

   * Minimal interface:

     ```txt
     Inputs:  model_family
     Output:  (World_T_experiment, World_F_experiment)
     ```

   * Preconditions:

     * The model family can produce or approximate spectral and confinement like summaries in a way compatible with `Encoding_YM_Class`.

### 8.2 Direct reuse targets

1. Q028 (Color confinement mechanism)

   * Reused components: `MassGapTensionFunctional_YM`, `ConfinementWorld_Template_YM`.
   * Reason: Q028 is directly concerned with how confinement emerges from gauge field dynamics, so it reuses the same functional to relate spectra and confinement indicators.
   * Change of focus: the emphasis shifts from existence of a mass gap to detailed mechanisms and observable signatures of confinement in hadronic states.

2. Q021 (Quantum gravity unification)

   * Reused component: `GaugeSpectrumField_Descriptor`.
   * Reason: in unification programs gauge sectors must interface with gravitational degrees of freedom, and spectral descriptors for the gauge part are required.
   * Change of focus: region descriptors now include curved backgrounds and coupling to gravity, but the spectral feature extraction pattern remains similar.

3. Q040 (Black hole information problem)

   * Reused component: `ConfinementWorld_Template_YM`.
   * Reason: certain models of black hole microstates use gauge theories on boundaries or horizons, and the confining versus deconfining behavior has implications for information storage.
   * Change of focus: the model families may include horizon localized theories and holographic duals, but the pattern of World T versus World F remains useful.

4. Q059 (Ultimate thermodynamic cost of information processing)

   * Reused component: `MassGapTensionFunctional_YM`.
   * Reason: mass gap like features in physical substrates set minimal energy scales for information carriers, which can be framed in terms of tension between spectral gaps and information flow.
   * Change of focus: the functional is applied to physical realizations of information processing devices based on gauge like substrates rather than to pure Yang Mills theories.

## 9. TU roadmap and verification levels

This block explains where Q012 currently sits in the TU verification ladder and what the next measurable steps are.

### 9.1 Current levels

* E_level: E1

  * A complete effective layer encoding of the Yang Mills mass gap problem has been specified. This means that at the effective layer, and not at the level of constructive quantum field theory, Q012 provides:

    * a state space `M_YM`,
    * mismatch observables `DeltaS_spec_YM` and `DeltaS_conf`,
    * a combined tension functional `Tension_YM`,
    * an explicit singular set `S_sing_YM` and domain restriction,
    * experiments with clear falsification conditions,
    * an explicit encoding class `Encoding_YM_Class` with fairness constraints.

* N_level: N1

  * The narrative connecting spectral gaps, confinement behavior, and tension functionals is explicit and coherent at the effective layer.
  * Counterfactual worlds and transfer components have been described.
  * Detailed refinement schemes and finite encoding libraries are outlined conceptually but not yet instantiated in a concrete public implementation.

### 9.2 Next measurable step toward E2

To upgrade Q012 from E1 to E2 the following concrete steps are envisioned:

1. Define a public, finite library of admissible encodings. Each element of this library specifies:

   * a fixed list of spectral windows and length scales,
   * explicit reference profiles for gapped spectra and confinement indicators,
   * fixed weights and coefficients satisfying the constraints of Sections 3 and 4.

2. Introduce a refinement index `k` and a corresponding scheme

   ```txt
   refine_YM(k): encoding_k in Encoding_YM_Class
   ```

   where each `encoding_k` specifies finer windows or scales and a clear relation between `Tension_YM(m_k)` and `Tension_YM(m_{k+1})` for world representing sequences `m_k`.

3. Establish measurable conditions on how `Tension_YM(m_k)` should behave for World T like and World F like scenarios under these refinements, including explicit bounds and stability criteria that are consistent with the TU Tension Scale Charter.

These steps remain inside the effective layer. They do not require revealing TU generative rules or any explicit path from bare lattice data to internal fields.

### 9.3 Long term role in the TU program

In the long run Q012 is expected to:

* serve as a flagship example of spectral_tension in mathematical physics, setting a standard for encoding nonperturbative existence problems,
* provide a bridge between rigorous quantum field theory, lattice gauge theory, and effective spectral descriptions that AI systems can handle,
* supply reusable components and patterns that generalize to other domains where spectral gaps and confinement like phenomena play a central role, such as condensed matter systems, holographic models, and information processing substrates.

## 10. Elementary but precise explanation

This block gives an explanation for non specialists that stays aligned with the effective layer description.

A Yang Mills theory is a mathematical model for certain forces in nature that uses gauge fields with a nonabelian symmetry group such as `SU(3)`. Physicists expect that the version of this theory describing the strong force has several key features:

1. It exists as a well defined quantum field theory, not just as a formal recipe for perturbative calculations.
2. It has a positive mass gap. There is a smallest nonzero energy level above the vacuum and no excitations with arbitrarily small positive energy.
3. It exhibits confinement. Isolated color charged particles cannot be observed and only neutral bound states appear.

The Clay Millennium problem asks mathematicians to prove that a four dimensional Yang Mills theory with these properties really exists for a given compact gauge group.

In the Tension Universe view, instead of trying to build the full theory directly inside this file, we ask two related questions:

* if such a theory exists, what patterns should we see in its spectra and in its confinement behavior,
* can we define a tension number that is small when those patterns look right and large when something is inconsistent.

We imagine a space of states. Each state summarizes:

* how the energy levels or masses are distributed in certain windows,
* how quickly gauge invariant quantities stop correlating over distance,
* how Wilson loops behave, which is a standard diagnostic for confinement.

From these summaries we compute two mismatch quantities:

* one measures how far the spectrum is from a reference gapped profile,
* the other measures how far the confinement behavior is from a reference confining pattern.

We combine them into a single tension number `Tension_YM`.

Then we consider two broad types of internal TU worlds at the effective layer:

* in a world where a consistent Yang Mills theory with a mass gap exists and describes nature, and where the encoding is faithful, we should be able to follow realistic data through finer and finer approximations and see that `Tension_YM` stays within a controlled low range;
* in a world where no such theory exists or where it cannot keep a true gap, any faithful attempt to encode the spectra and confinement behavior will eventually produce persistent high values of `Tension_YM` along some refinement paths.

This framework does not solve the original problem. It does not construct Yang Mills theories and it does not claim to know whether a mass gap really exists. What it provides is:

* a clean way to express the existence and mass gap question as a low versus high tension principle,
* a family of experiments that can test whether particular ways of encoding Yang Mills behavior are reasonable and stable,
* reusable tools for AI systems and for other problems that also involve hidden spectra and observable behavior.

Q012 is therefore a prototype for how to treat a deep open problem in mathematical physics inside the Tension Universe. It respects the boundary between effective descriptions and deep generative rules while still making the problem precise enough to be tested, discussed, and reused as a module in larger reasoning systems.

## Tension Universe effective layer footer

This page is part of the **WFGY / Tension Universe** S problem collection.

### Scope of claims

* The goal of this document is to specify an effective layer encoding of the named problem.
* It does not claim to prove or disprove the canonical statement in Section 1.
* It does not introduce any new theorem beyond what is already established in the cited literature.
* It should not be cited as evidence that the corresponding open problem has been solved.
* Any use of the words “world”, “state”, or “encoding” refers to internal TU constructs and not directly to the physical universe.

### Effective layer boundary

* All objects used here (state spaces `M`, observables, invariants, tension scores, counterfactual worlds) live at the effective layer of the TU framework.
* Deep generative rules, base axioms, and internal construction mechanisms for TU are intentionally not specified in this file.
* Experiments and protocols described here test the behavior of effective layer encodings only. They do not test or decide the truth of the canonical open problem itself.
* Nothing in this file should be interpreted as exposing or modifying any underlying TU generative rule.

### Encoding and fairness

* The encodings used in this page are constrained by the TU Encoding and Fairness Charter and by the TU Tension Scale Charter.
* Any use of the phrases “low tension” or “high tension” follows the fixed scale and conventions defined in those charters.
* All parameter choices described here are required to be set in advance at the encoding design stage and must not be tuned on individual instances in response to observed tension values.
* Any modification to the admissible encoding class for this problem requires a charter level update and may not be introduced silently inside this page.

### Tension scale and thresholds

* All scalar tension quantities in this page, including `DeltaS_spec_YM`, `DeltaS_conf`, `DeltaS_YM`, `Tension_YM`, `epsilon_YM`, and `delta_YM`, live on the TU tension scale.
* Numerical thresholds that distinguish low tension from high tension must be chosen in advance according to the TU Tension Scale Charter.
* No experiment or protocol in this file is allowed to choose or adjust thresholds after inspecting particular data instances.

### Versioning and non mutation policy

* The `Last_updated` field in the header metadata marks the version of this effective layer encoding that is intended for public audit.
* Once a version is published, its contents are considered frozen for the purpose of external verification. Substantive changes require a new version with an updated `Last_updated` date and a corresponding change log outside this file.
* Silent modification of encodings, parameter libraries, or interpretation rules under an unchanged `Last_updated` date is not permitted within the TU framework.

### Reference charters

This page should be read together with the following charters:

* [TU Effective Layer Charter](../Charters/TU_EFFECTIVE_LAYER_CHARTER.md)
* [TU Encoding and Fairness Charter](../Charters/TU_ENCODING_AND_FAIRNESS_CHARTER.md)
* [TU Tension Scale Charter](../Charters/TU_TENSION_SCALE_CHARTER.md)

## 0. Effective layer disclaimer

All content in this entry is restricted to the Tension Universe (TU) effective layer.

* The canonical problem in Section 1 is stated in standard cosmology language and remains an open scientific problem.
* This document specifies an effective-layer encoding of large scale structure formation as a consistency_tension problem. It does not claim to solve or close the canonical problem.
* No new theorem, physical law, or fundamental axiom is introduced here. Wherever existing literature is mentioned, it is used as background and not as part of a proof of any new result.
* State spaces such as `M_LSS`, observables, mismatch functionals, tension scores, counterfactual worlds, and transfer components are effective-layer objects. They are not microscopic fields or fundamental degrees of freedom.
* The mapping from raw data or simulations to effective-layer summaries is treated as an external modelling choice and is not specified in this document.
* This page should not be cited as evidence that large scale structure formation is fully understood or that any specific cosmological model has been confirmed or ruled out.

Within this boundary, Q045 defines a reusable encoding, a tension principle, and falsifiable experiment patterns that can be implemented and tested without exposing any TU generative rules.

## 1. Canonical problem and status

### 1.1 Canonical statement

In standard cosmology, large scale structure formation refers to the growth of matter density fluctuations from tiny perturbations in the early universe into the present-day cosmic web of galaxies, clusters, filaments, and voids.

Within a model family such as LambdaCDM, a schematic story is:

* Early-universe physics, including inflation and recombination, sets an initial power spectrum of density perturbations.
* Linear and non linear gravitational evolution, with contributions from dark matter, baryons, radiation, and dark energy, amplifies and reshapes these perturbations.
* The result is a statistical pattern of structure that can be probed via:

  * galaxy clustering,
  * baryon acoustic oscillations,
  * weak lensing,
  * cluster abundance,
  * and related tracers.

At the effective layer, the BlackHole S problem Q045 is phrased as:

> Does there exist a single, coherent model family of cosmology and structure formation, with a single set of parameters and initial conditions, that yields large scale structure observables consistent with all current high-quality datasets across redshift and length scales, when those observables are encoded as a consistency_tension functional.

Equivalently:

* Given:

  * early-universe constraints on the primordial power spectrum and background expansion,
  * late-time observations of the cosmic web across many tracers,
* can we find a model family and parameter set such that a well defined tension functional, which compares predicted and observed large scale structure patterns across a fixed library of scale and redshift windows, remains within a controlled low band for the universe we inhabit.

If the answer is yes for some encoding in the admissible class, we say the large scale structure formation story is globally low tension within that model family. If the answer is no for all admissible encodings, we say there is persistent high tension that signals missing physics, mis modelling, or inconsistencies among datasets.

This formulation is part of the TU effective layer and does not alter the canonical physical statement.

### 1.2 Status and difficulty

From a traditional cosmology perspective:

* The LambdaCDM framework, combined with cold dark matter and a cosmological constant like dark energy, provides a highly successful description of large scale structure on many scales.
* Linear theory and perturbation theory, plus non linear simulations and halo models, can reproduce many features of:

  * galaxy clustering,
  * baryon acoustic oscillations,
  * weak lensing,
  * cluster abundance.

However there are persistent open issues and tensions, for example:

* small scale structure problems such as missing satellites, core versus cusp questions, and too-big-to-fail patterns,
* the impact of baryonic feedback on matter clustering and halo profiles,
* possible tensions between structure growth inferred from weak lensing and from cosmic microwave background constraints,
* uncertainties in modelling non linear scales and galaxy bias,
* sensitivity of conclusions to simulation calibrations and analysis pipelines.

The problem in Q045 is not to re derive structure formation from first principles inside this document. Instead it is:

* to encode the global consistency question as a structured consistency_tension problem,
* to test whether a single model family can be simultaneously consistent with early and late observables under a fixed encoding instance in the admissible class,
* and to identify where and how the tension functional signals robust inconsistencies.

The difficulty remains high because:

* datasets are heterogeneous and probe different scales and redshifts,
* non linear evolution requires complex modelling and approximation choices,
* astrophysical processes introduce additional uncertainty and effective parameters,
* subtle model dependence can enter when combining or comparing datasets.

Q045 keeps these difficulties explicit and treats them as inputs to the effective-layer encoding rather than as objects to be derived.

### 1.3 Role in the BlackHole graph

Within the BlackHole S problem collection, Q045 plays three main roles at the effective layer:

1. It is the primary node for consistency_tension at cosmological scales, linking:

   * early-universe initial conditions,
   * late-time structure growth,
   * cross dataset comparisons in large scale structure.
2. It provides the reference encoding of:

   * matter density fields and their statistical summaries,
   * large scale structure observables across scale and redshift windows,
   * cross consistency functionals between different probes.
3. It acts as a bridge between:

   * foundational cosmology questions such as dark matter, inflation, and initial conditions,
   * downstream questions about black hole seeding, growth, and global cosmic history,
   * and cross domain problems in information and thermodynamics that reuse consistency_tension patterns.

The rest of this entry defines that role precisely in terms of state spaces, observables, tension functionals, counterfactual worlds, experiment patterns, and transfer components.

## 2. Position in the BlackHole graph

This block records the adjacency of Q045 to other nodes in the Q001 to Q125 graph. Each edge is justified by a one line reason that refers to specific components or tension types, not vague similarity. All references are at the TU effective layer.

### 2.1 Upstream problems

These nodes provide prerequisites, tools, or background for Q045.

* Q041 (BH_COSMO_DM_L3_041: Dark matter and cosmic structure)

### 2.3 Parallel problems

Parallel nodes share a similar tension structure but have no direct component dependency.

  Reason: Both use correlation length and critical like behavior as key features in a consistency_tension functional.

### 2.4 Cross domain edges

These connect Q045 to nodes in other domains via reusable patterns.

* Q032 (BH_PHYS_QTHERMO_L3_032: Quantum thermodynamics and entropy)
  Reason: Reuses Q045 scale windowed consistency between microscopic dynamics and macroscopic fields in a thermodynamic context.

* Q059 (BH_CS_INFO_THERMODYN_L3_059: Information and thermodynamics)
  Reason: Reuses Q045 LSS_TensionScore style functionals to measure how much information about initial conditions is retained in macroscopic patterns.

* Q123 (BH_AI_INTERP_L3_123: AI interpretability and internal structure)
  Reason: Treats AI internal activations as a kind of structure field and reuses Q045 consistency_tension encoding across layers and tasks.

All cross references are effective-layer links between encodings and do not imply shared microscopic physics.

## 3. Tension Universe encoding (effective layer)

This block defines the effective layer encoding used to treat large scale structure formation as a consistency_tension problem. It does not describe any hidden generative rules or raw data to field mappings. All such mappings are treated as external to this document.

### 3.1 State space

We postulate a state space:

```txt
M_LSS
```

with the following interpretation at the effective layer:

* Each state `m` in `M_LSS` represents a coherent large scale structure configuration, including:

  * summarized matter density field information across comoving scales and redshifts,
  * summarized observed large scale structure statistics,
  * summarized predicted statistics from a specific cosmological model and parameter set.

We do not specify how these summaries are computed from survey catalogues or simulations. At the effective layer we only require:

1. For any chosen:

   * redshift window `Z = [z_min, z_max]` within an allowed range,
   * comoving wavenumber window `K = [k_min, k_max]` within an allowed range,
     there exist states `m` that carry well defined summaries covering `Z` and `K`.
2. For any such state `m`, it is meaningful to compare:

   * predicted and observed power spectra,
   * predicted and observed correlation functions,
     in those windows.

The state space `M_LSS` is an effective layer construct and is not identified with any particular microscopic phase space.

### 3.2 Scale and window library

To avoid uncontrolled continuous suprema and scale choice ambiguity, we fix once and for all a finite library of scale and redshift windows:

```txt
K_windows = { K_1, K_2, ..., K_J }
Z_windows = { Z_1, Z_2, ..., Z_L }
```

where:

* each `K_j` is a bounded interval in comoving wavenumber,
* each `Z_l` is a bounded redshift interval,
* the pairs `(K_j, Z_l)` cover the region where:

  * theory predictions are believed to be reliable,
  * and observational data are sufficiently robust.

We also fix a refinement ordering:

```txt
refine_level = 0, 1, 2, ...
```

such that:

* level 0 uses a coarse subset of windows,
* higher levels add more windows or narrower windows,
* the total number of windows per level remains finite.

The mapping from `K_j` to `Z_l` for each refinement level is encoded once when the encoding instance is designed and is not adjusted in response to data outcomes. This provides a discrete notion of refinement without invoking continuous suprema or post hoc scale selection.

### 3.3 Observables and mismatch functionals

For each `m` in `M_LSS` and for each allowed window pair `(K_j, Z_l)` we define the following effective observables.

1. Observed matter power spectrum summary

```txt
P_obs(m; K_j, Z_l)
```

* A scalar or low dimensional vector summarizing the observed power spectrum in window `(K_j, Z_l)` as encoded in `m`.

2. Predicted matter power spectrum summary

```txt
P_pred(m; K_j, Z_l)
```

* A scalar or low dimensional vector summarizing the predicted power spectrum in the same window for the cosmological model and parameters encoded in `m`.

3. Power spectrum mismatch

```txt
DeltaS_LSS_power(m; K_j, Z_l) >= 0
```

* A nonnegative scalar measuring the mismatch between `P_obs` and `P_pred` in window `(K_j, Z_l)`.
* `DeltaS_LSS_power(m; K_j, Z_l) = 0` if and only if the observed and predicted summaries coincide within the encoding resolution for that window.

4. Observed correlation function summary

```txt
xi_obs(m; R_j, Z_l)
```

where `R_j` is a comoving separation interval associated with `K_j`.

5. Predicted correlation function summary

```txt
xi_pred(m; R_j, Z_l)
```

6. Correlation mismatch

```txt
DeltaS_LSS_corr(m; R_j, Z_l) >= 0
```

* `DeltaS_LSS_corr(m; R_j, Z_l) = 0` when the observed and predicted correlation summaries coincide within the encoding resolution.

These objects are effective layer observables attached to `M_LSS`. They do not encode microscopic fields.

### 3.4 Admissible encoding class and reference fairness

To prevent hidden tuning and to make `DeltaS_LSS` falsifiable, we define an admissible encoding class `C_LSS`. Each encoding instance `E` in `C_LSS` is specified by:

1. Window families:

   * The window families `K_windows` and `Z_windows` used by `E` are fixed before any dataset is evaluated.
   * They may depend on broad theoretical considerations such as linear versus non linear scales and data coverage, but not on detailed properties of the specific dataset under test.

2. Metrics and norms:

   * For each window pair `(K_j, Z_l)`, the distance between `P_obs` and `P_pred`, and between `xi_obs` and `xi_pred`, is measured with a fixed norm chosen when `E` is defined.
   * This norm cannot be redefined per dataset or per model class.

3. Weight vectors:

   * We fix nonnegative weight vectors:

     ```txt
     w_power = (w_power_1, ..., w_power_J)
     w_corr  = (w_corr_1,  ..., w_corr_J)
     ```
   * These weights satisfy:

     ```txt
     sum over j of w_power_j = 1
     sum over j of w_corr_j  = 1
     ```
   * The weights are chosen before any dataset specific evaluation and do not depend on the outcomes of the experiments.

4. Finite reference library:

   * For each window `(K_j, Z_l)` we fix a finite library of allowed reference models `L_ref(j, l)`, for example:

     * baseline LambdaCDM like shapes,
     * specific non linear correction schemes,
     * a small number of alternative gravity or dark matter prescriptions that can be mapped into the same effective summaries.
   * Encodings must select prediction methods from this library, with the choice documented at the effective layer.
   * The library is fixed in advance and cannot be extended or altered in response to tension outcomes in a given experiment.

5. Redshift mapping:

   * For each `K_j` we define a mapping to a redshift window `Z_level_for_j` at each refinement level.
   * This mapping is fixed when `E` is defined and cannot be adjusted after seeing the data or tension results.

Within an encoding instance `E` in `C_LSS`, for each state `m` we define the combined mismatch:

```txt
DeltaS_LSS(m) =
  DeltaS_LSS_power_global(m) + DeltaS_LSS_corr_global(m)
```

where:

```txt
DeltaS_LSS_power_global(m) =
  sum over j of w_power_j * DeltaS_LSS_power(m; K_j, Z_level_for_j)

DeltaS_LSS_corr_global(m) =
  sum over j of w_corr_j  * DeltaS_LSS_corr(m; R_j, Z_level_for_j)
```

The mapping `j -> Z_level_for_j` is part of the encoding instance and is common to all states `m` evaluated under that encoding.

Within any single experiment or comparison, a single encoding instance `E` in `C_LSS` must be fixed and applied to all states, datasets, and model classes. Encodings cannot be swapped between subsets of the experiment.

### 3.5 Tension tensor and singular set

For each encoding instance `E` and each `m` in `M_LSS`, we define the effective tension tensor:

```txt
T_ij_LSS(m) =
  S_i_LSS(m) * C_j_LSS(m) * DeltaS_LSS(m) * lambda_LSS(m) * kappa_LSS
```

where:

* `S_i_LSS(m)` is a source like factor for the ith component, for example sensitivity to a particular scale or redshift band.
* `C_j_LSS(m)` is a coupling factor indicating the impact on the jth downstream process or reasoning module.
* `DeltaS_LSS(m)` is the combined mismatch defined in Section 3.4.
* `lambda_LSS(m)` indicates the convergence or stability state of the encoding for `m`, with values in a fixed bounded interval chosen when the encoding is defined.
* `kappa_LSS` is a positive constant setting the overall scale of LSS related consistency_tension.

The tensor `T_ij_LSS(m)` is an optional internal diagnostic. The falsifiability conditions in Section 6 depend only on the scalar tension functional defined in Section 4, not on individual components of `T_ij_LSS`.

To control pathological cases we define the singular set:

```txt
S_sing_LSS = { m in M_LSS :
  DeltaS_LSS(m) is undefined,
  or some required window quantities are missing,
  or theoretical control is known to be broken in all library models
}
```

We restrict all effective layer arguments about Q045 to the regular domain:

```txt
M_LSS_reg = M_LSS \ S_sing_LSS
```

Any attempt to use states in `S_sing_LSS` for evaluating tension is treated as out of domain rather than as evidence about the physical universe.

---

## 4. Tension principle for this problem

This block states how Q045 is framed as a consistency_tension problem at the effective layer, using the objects from Section 3.

### 4.1 Core LSS tension functional

Within an encoding instance `E` in the admissible class `C_LSS`, for each state `m` in `M_LSS_reg` we define:

```txt
Tension_LSS(m) = DeltaS_LSS(m)
```

with:

* `Tension_LSS(m) >= 0` for all `m` in `M_LSS_reg`,
* `Tension_LSS(m) = 0` if and only if all per window mismatches

  * `DeltaS_LSS_power(m; K_j, Z_level_for_j)` and
  * `DeltaS_LSS_corr(m; R_j, Z_level_for_j)`
    vanish for all windows used at the chosen refinement level.

Different refinement levels are allowed. Once a refinement level is chosen for an experiment:

* the set of windows is fixed,
* the weights remain those specified in `w_power` and `w_corr`,
* no ad hoc exclusion of windows is allowed based on their individual contribution to tension.

The functional `Tension_LSS` is an effective layer scalar associated with the encoding instance `E`. It does not represent any fundamental physical energy, action, or stress tensor.

### 4.2 Low tension LSS principle

The low tension principle for Q045 can be expressed as follows.

At the effective layer we consider:

* a fixed encoding instance `E` in `C_LSS`,
* a universe represented by a state `m_real` in `M_LSS_reg`,
* a set of cosmological parameter sets that are consistent with early universe constraints.

We then ask whether there exist:

* a parameter set and prediction scheme allowed by the finite reference library,
* a refinement level `refine_level_star` within the regime of reliable theory and data,

such that:

```txt
Tension_LSS(m_real) <= epsilon_LSS
```

for a small threshold `epsilon_LSS` that is chosen when the encoding instance is designed and does not diverge when the encoding is modestly refined or when observational data are improved within advertised ranges.

Informally:

* Starting from a parameter set that fits early universe constraints, and using a fixed LSS encoding within `C_LSS`:

  * the tension estimates should stay within a low, controlled band when:

    * we add more LSS datasets that are considered robust,
    * we refine scale and redshift windows in ways specified in the encoding,
    * we stay within regions where both theory and data are known to be reliable according to predefined criteria.

A world satisfying this principle for at least one encoding instance in `C_LSS` is called a low tension LSS world for that encoding instance.

### 4.3 Persistent high tension

The complementary possibility is that for a given model family and encoding class:

* For every encoding instance `E` in `C_LSS`,
* For every sequence of refinement levels within the advertised regime,
* For every parameter set and prediction scheme chosen from the finite reference library consistent with early universe constraints,

the tension value `Tension_LSS(m_real_E_L)` for states representing the actual universe eventually exceeds a strictly positive lower bound `delta_LSS` in at least one key group of windows, in a way that cannot be eliminated without leaving the admissible class.

Formally, for a world of this type:

```txt
For all encodings E in C_LSS,
  for all allowed parameter choices under E,
    there exists a refinement level L and a set of windows at level L such that
      Tension_LSS(m_real_E_L) >= delta_LSS > 0
```

where:

* `m_real_E_L` is the state encoding the actual universe under encoding `E` at level `L`.

Such a world is a high tension LSS world for that model family and encoding class, indicating that the combination of the model family and encoding is insufficient to reconcile early and late observables in a low tension way.

Q045 does not assert which regime the real universe falls into. It encodes the difference as a well defined tension principle that can be probed by experiments on data and model worlds.

---

## 5. Counterfactual tension worlds

We describe two counterfactual worlds at the effective layer.

* World T: a universe in which a standard model family such as LambdaCDM, with appropriate parameter values, yields low LSS tension across datasets and windows under at least one encoding instance in `C_LSS`.
* World F: a universe in which no such model family within the admissible class can achieve low LSS tension under any encoding instance in `C_LSS`.

We do not construct these worlds from first principles. We only describe patterns of observables and tension outcomes.

### 5.1 World T: LSS consistent universe

In World T:

1. Common parameter set:

   * There exists a parameter set and prediction scheme in the finite library such that:

     * CMB constraints,
     * galaxy clustering data,
     * weak lensing data,
     * cluster abundance data,
       are all simultaneously consistent with the same parameter values at the effective layer when evaluated under a fixed encoding instance.

2. Low tension across windows:

   * For states `m_T` encoding actual data under that parameter set, and for a range of refinement levels up to some `L_max`, we have:

     ```txt
     Tension_LSS(m_T) <= epsilon_LSS
     ```

     where `epsilon_LSS` is the small positive constant fixed when the encoding instance is designed.

3. Stable refinement behavior:

   * As refinement level increases from `L` to `L + 1`:

     * new windows may be added,
     * the overall tension stays within a band that does not grow systematically beyond the expected effect of added resolution and statistical noise.
   * Any fluctuations in `Tension_LSS(m_T)` remain within well motivated statistical and systematic uncertainty expectations documented in the encoding.

4. Dataset cross consistency:

   * Combined fits or joint analyses of different datasets do not require incompatible parameter shifts beyond stated uncertainties.
   * Large scale structure observables derived from different tracers such as galaxies and lensing are mutually consistent under the chosen model.

World T provides a reference pattern for what it means for large scale structure formation to be globally low tension in the TU sense.

### 5.2 World F: LSS inconsistent universe

In World F:

1. Parameter incompatibility:

   * No single parameter set from the admissible class, combined with any prediction scheme in the finite library, can fit both:

     * early universe constraints such as the primordial power spectrum inferred from CMB,
     * and late-time large scale structure data,
       without producing large residuals in at least one key observable window.

2. Window level tension:

   * For every encoding instance and parameter set, there exists at least one refinement level where:

     ```txt
     Tension_LSS(m_F) >= delta_LSS
     ```

     with `delta_LSS` strictly positive, and this high tension is associated with specific windows such as:

     * small scales where predicted clustering is too high or too low,
     * intermediate scales where different tracers disagree,
     * high redshift where early structure formation is mispredicted.

3. Refinement instability:

   * As refinements increase the resolution of the analysis, new windows systematically reveal additional tension rather than merely fluctuating within predicted uncertainty bands.
   * Attempts to mitigate tension by cherry picking windows are disallowed by the fixed window library and weight constraints.

4. Cross dataset conflict:

   * Separate fits to different datasets may appear individually acceptable under their own encodings,
   * but joint fits using a single parameter set and a single encoding instance systematically fail, and this failure persists under any allowed encoding in `C_LSS` built from the same finite library.

World F provides a reference pattern for persistent high LSS tension.

### 5.3 Interpretive note

These counterfactual worlds are not direct physical models. They are logically distinct patterns of outcomes for the LSS tension functional under the TU encoding rules.

* In World T, there exists at least one low tension encoding instance within `C_LSS`.
* In World F, no such encoding instance exists for the model family under consideration.

Q045 focuses on defining and testing the encoding and its tension principle, not on asserting which world we inhabit.

## 6. Falsifiability and discriminating experiments

This block outlines experiments that can falsify specific choices of LSS encodings within `C_LSS`. They do not prove or disprove the underlying cosmological model family, but they can show that a given tension encoding is ineffective, misaligned, or unstable at the effective layer.

### Experiment 1: Real data global LSS tension profile

**Goal**

Test whether a specified LSS tension encoding instance, built from a finite reference library and fixed window families, yields a small and stable `Tension_LSS` when applied to real data under parameter sets consistent with early universe constraints.

**Setup**

* Inputs:

  * A finite set of cosmological parameter sets that are consistent with early universe data such as CMB constraints up to a specified confidence level.
  * Large scale structure datasets including:

    * galaxy clustering and baryon acoustic oscillations in several redshift bins,
    * weak lensing shear power spectra or correlation functions,
    * cluster mass function estimates from X ray or optical surveys.
* Encoding class:

  * A particular encoding instance `E` in `C_LSS` is fully specified before this experiment is run, including:

    * window families `K_windows`, `Z_windows`,
    * weights `w_power`, `w_corr`,
    * mapping from `K_j` to `Z_level_for_j` at each refinement level,
    * prediction schemes selected from the finite reference library `L_ref(j,l)`,
    * norms used to define per window mismatches.

The encoding instance `E` is fixed before looking at the detailed properties of the LSS datasets used in this experiment, and remains fixed for all parameter sets evaluated.

**Protocol**

1. Choose a refinement level `L_test` within the regime where both theoretical predictions and data are considered reliable under `E`.
2. For each parameter set in the allowed list:

   * construct a state `m_data` in `M_LSS_reg` that encodes:

     * predicted power spectra and correlations in all windows at level `L_test`,
     * observed summaries with uncertainties in the same windows.
3. For each `m_data`, compute:

   * per window mismatches `DeltaS_LSS_power(m_data; K_j, Z_level_for_j)`,
   * per window mismatches `DeltaS_LSS_corr(m_data; R_j, Z_level_for_j)`,
   * global tension `Tension_LSS(m_data)`.
4. Increase refinement from `L_test` to `L_test + 1` by adding the windows specified by `E`, and repeat the computation.
5. Record:

   * all `Tension_LSS(m_data)` values at both refinement levels,
   * per window mismatches for a subset of key windows.

In addition, one may consider small, predefined perturbations of the encoding instance inside `C_LSS`, such as:

* adjusting weights `w_power_j` and `w_corr_j` within a narrow band around their original values,
* switching between a small set of pre declared prediction schemes in `L_ref(j,l)` that are considered theoretically comparable.

These perturbations must be specified before the data are evaluated and cannot involve changing the window families or adding new models to the library.

**Metrics**

For each refinement level `L` we compute:

* `T_max(L)`: maximum value of `Tension_LSS(m_data)` across all allowed parameter sets.
* `T_median(L)`: median tension value across all allowed parameter sets.
* `W_high(L)`: fraction of windows at level `L` where per window mismatch exceeds a fixed threshold `tau_window`, chosen when `E` is defined.

These metrics are evaluated for `L = L_test` and `L = L_test + 1`.

**Falsification conditions**

The encoding instance `E` is considered falsified at the effective layer if all of the following hold:

1. For both levels `L_test` and `L_test + 1` we have:

   ```txt
   T_max(L) > tau_global
   ```

   where `tau_global` is a predefined upper bound for acceptable tension in a low tension world.
2. The fraction of high tension windows satisfies:

   ```txt
   W_high(L_test)      >= f_min
   and
   W_high(L_test + 1)  >= f_min
   ```

   for a predefined `f_min`, for example at least one third of the windows.
3. For the predefined small perturbations of the encoding instance inside `C_LSS`:

   * neither `T_max(L)` nor `W_high(L)` can be simultaneously reduced below their thresholds at both refinement levels.

If these conditions are met, the encoding instance `E` is judged ineffective or misaligned with the intended role of Q045 and must be revised or replaced.

**Semantics implementation note**

All quantities in this experiment are treated as continuous field summaries consistent with the metadata in Section 0. Any discretization arises from finite windowing and binning choices made when defining `K_windows` and `Z_windows`.

**Boundary note**

Falsifying a TU encoding instance is not the same as solving the canonical problem. This experiment can reject a specific LSS tension encoding within `C_LSS`, but does not by itself identify the correct physical cosmological model.

### Experiment 2: Mock universe discrimination across model classes

**Goal**

Check whether the LSS tension encoding can distinguish between different cosmological model classes that are known to behave differently in simulations, for example:

* standard gravity with cold dark matter,
* models with modified gravity,
* models with warm or self interacting dark matter,

when all are tuned to fit a selected subset of observables.

**Setup**

* Model classes:

  * A finite set of cosmology model classes, each with its own parameter ranges and prediction schemes, but all mapped into the same finite reference library for LSS predictions at the effective layer.
* Mock datasets:

  * For each model class, mock catalogues are generated or imported that:

    * match a selected subset of observables such as BAO positions and large scale clustering within uncertainties,
    * but differ in small scale clustering, halo properties, or growth histories in controlled ways.
* Encoding:

  * The same encoding instance `E` in `C_LSS` as in Experiment 1 is used, with the same window families, weights, norms, and reference library.

Before running the experiment we fix a parameter selection rule such as:

* each model class may choose its own best fit parameter set with respect to the subset of observables used to generate the mocks, under the constraint that all tension evaluations use the common encoding instance `E`, or
* a single reference parameter set is used across all mocks to emphasise structural differences.

The rule is chosen and documented before looking at the results of `Tension_LSS`.

**Protocol**

1. For each mock universe in each model class:

   * construct a state `m_mock` representing its structure formation summaries across the defined windows under encoding `E`.
2. Compute:

   * `Tension_LSS(m_mock)` for each mock universe, using the parameter selection rule chosen in the setup.
3. Organise the results into distributions of tension values by model class.

**Metrics**

For each model class `C` we compute:

* mean tension `T_mean(C)`,
* variance `T_var(C)`,
* fraction `F_low(C)` of mock universes with tension below a low tension threshold `tau_low`, chosen when the experiment is designed.

We may also compute pairwise separations between classes in simple summary spaces, for example:

* differences in `T_mean(C)`,
* differences in `F_low(C)`.

**Falsification conditions**

The encoding instance `E` is considered inadequate for Q045 if any of the following occurs:

1. Known good class indistinguishability:

   * A class representing a standard, well tested cosmology model and a class representing a known pathological model, with clearly unrealistic structure formation in simulations, yield tension distributions that are statistically indistinguishable according to the chosen metrics.
2. Inverted performance:

   * A clearly non standard or pathological model class has a significantly lower `T_mean(C)` and higher `F_low(C)` than a standard reference class across multiple independent mock realisations.
3. Extreme sensitivity to minor encoding changes:

   * Small, justified variations in the encoding instance inside `C_LSS`, such as those described in Experiment 1, cause the ordering of `T_mean(C)` across model classes to flip repeatedly, indicating that the encoding is dominated by arbitrary choices rather than robust structural differences.

If one or more of these conditions occur, the encoding instance does not provide a meaningful consistency_tension measure for large scale structure and must be refined or replaced.

**Semantics implementation note**

All mock universes are encoded using the same continuous field interpretation of densities and correlation functions. Differences in microscopic simulation details do not affect the effective layer definitions of the observables and mismatch functionals.

**Boundary note**

Falsifying a TU encoding instance is not the same as solving the canonical problem. Success or failure in separating model classes only evaluates the quality of the chosen LSS encoding, not the truth of any underlying cosmological theory.

## 7. AI and WFGY engineering spec

This block describes how Q045 can be used inside AI systems and WFGY based tools at the effective layer. All signals and modules here are auxiliary structures layered on top of existing models.

### 7.1 Training signals

We define several training signals that can be used as auxiliary losses or diagnostic outputs.

1. `signal_LSS_consistency`

   * Definition:

     * `signal_LSS_consistency = Tension_LSS(m)` for the current internal representation `m` of a cosmology scenario.
   * Usage:

     * As a penalty that encourages the model to produce narratives and parameter choices with smaller tension in contexts that assume a standard, coherent cosmology.
2. `signal_scale_tension_profile`

   * Definition:

     * A vector of per window tension values:

       ```txt
       signal_scale_tension_profile(j) =
         DeltaS_LSS_power(m; K_j, Z_level_for_j) +
         DeltaS_LSS_corr(m; R_j, Z_level_for_j)
       ```
   * Usage:

     * As an interpretable signal indicating which scales and redshift ranges contribute most to global inconsistency.
3. `signal_dataset_cross_consistency`

   * Definition:

     * A scalar derived from comparing tensions across subsets of windows associated with different datasets such as CMB anchored LSS constraints, galaxy clustering, lensing, and cluster counts.
   * Usage:

     * As an internal check on whether the model is implicitly using incompatible parameter stories for different datasets within the same conversation or scenario.
4. `signal_world_switch_sensitivity`

   * Definition:

     * A measure of how much `Tension_LSS(m)` and the model answers change when the user explicitly asks it to assume a low tension world World T versus a high tension world World F.
   * Usage:

     * To encourage clear separation between assumptions, avoiding hidden mixing of incompatible scenarios.

These signals are auxiliary training or evaluation tools. They do not force any particular cosmological model to be true.

### 7.2 Architectural patterns

We outline module patterns for integrating Q045 into AI architectures.

1. `CosmicWebField_Observer`

   * Role:

     * Extracts coarse grained descriptors from internal representations when the context involves cosmology or structure formation.
   * Interface:

     * Input:

       * internal embeddings related to cosmology narratives,
       * optional explicit parameter tokens that refer to cosmological parameters.
     * Output:

       * estimated summaries corresponding to:

         * `P_obs` and `P_pred` style quantities,
         * `xi_obs` and `xi_pred` style quantities,
           across a small subset of windows chosen for interpretability.
2. `LSS_TensionHead`

   * Role:

     * Produces estimates of `DeltaS_LSS_power`, `DeltaS_LSS_corr`, and global `Tension_LSS(m)` given the descriptors from the observer.
   * Interface:

     * Input:

       * outputs of `CosmicWebField_Observer`,
       * optional flags specifying which window subsets to consider.
     * Output:

       * scalar `Tension_LSS`,
       * per window contributions for interpretability and training.
3. `DatasetConsistencyFilter`

   * Role:

     * Checks whether different parts of a conversation, associated with different datasets, correspond to a single coherent parameter set at the effective layer.
   * Interface:

     * Input:

       * internal snapshots of reasoning chains tagged by dataset type.
     * Output:

       * a binary or graded signal indicating whether they can be reconciled under one parameter set according to Q045 encoding.

These modules can be implemented inside a general purpose AI system without exposing any TU generative rules. They operate entirely at the level of effective layer descriptors and tension scores.

### 7.3 Evaluation harness

A basic evaluation harness for AI systems augmented with Q045 components could proceed as follows.

1. Task suite:

   * A set of multi part questions that require reasoning about:

     * how initial perturbations grow into structures,
     * how different datasets constrain model parameters,
     * and how possible tensions arise or are resolved.
2. Baseline condition:

   * The model answers the tasks without Q045 specific modules or signals.
3. TU enhanced condition:

   * The model answers the tasks with:

     * `CosmicWebField_Observer` and `LSS_TensionHead` active,
     * a loss or regularisation term based on `signal_LSS_consistency`,
     * optional use of `DatasetConsistencyFilter` during generation or re ranking.
4. Metrics:

   * Expert graded coherence scores:

     * consistency between different parts of the answer,
     * correct identification of where tensions might arise,
     * correct identification of which datasets are in broad agreement.
   * Stability scores:

     * how often the model changes its story under small perturbations of the prompt.
   * Tension awareness:

     * how accurately the model reported tension profile matches a reference evaluation of `Tension_LSS(m)` performed by a separate tool.

The harness evaluates whether Q045 modules make reasoning about large scale structure more structured and self aware.

### 7.4 60 second reproduction protocol

To allow external users to feel the effect of Q045 quickly, we suggest the following protocol.

1. Baseline run:

   * Prompt:

     * Ask the model to describe how tiny fluctuations in the early universe lead to the cosmic web and to explain how galaxy surveys and weak lensing are used to test this story, without mentioning tension or TU.
   * Observation:

     * Record whether the answer treats different datasets as disconnected facts or as parts of a single consistent picture.
2. TU encoded run:

   * Prompt:

     * Ask the same high level question but explicitly instruct the model:

       * to organise the answer around consistency between early universe initial conditions and late time structure,
       * to identify where there might be high or low tension between datasets,
       * and to think in terms of an abstract scalar LSS tension between predictions and observations.
   * Observation:

     * Record whether the answer now:

       * distinguishes early and late observables,
       * describes how they are linked by one model family,
       * and points out where consistency checks are non trivial.
3. Comparison metric:

   * Qualitative:

     * Does the TU encoded answer explicitly:

       * distinguish early and late constraints,
       * describe how they are linked,
       * and identify plausible locations of tension.
   * Optional numeric:

     * If the model exposes estimated `Tension_LSS` values, compare:

       * the presence of high tension claims in contexts where known tensions exist,
       * with contexts where data are known to be broadly consistent.
4. Logs:

   * Store:

     * prompts,
     * raw answers,
     * any tension estimates produced by internal heads,
       for later inspection, without revealing any TU generative mechanism.

## 8. Cross problem transfer template

This block specifies reusable components from Q045 and their direct reuse targets. All components are effective layer constructs.

### 8.1 Reusable components produced by this problem

1. ComponentName: `LSS_TensionScore`

   * Type: functional
   * Minimal interface:

     * Inputs:

       * predicted LSS summaries, grouped by window,
       * observed LSS summaries, grouped by window,
       * fixed window families and weight vectors from an encoding instance `E`.
     * Output:

       * nonnegative scalar `DeltaS_LSS(m)` as defined in Section 3.4.
   * Preconditions:

     * inputs must be given for all required windows in at least one refinement level,
     * inputs must obey basic regularity such as no missing data for required windows and bounded uncertainties.
2. ComponentName: `CosmicWebField_Descriptor`

   * Type: field descriptor
   * Minimal interface:

     * Inputs:

       * definitions of scale and redshift windows,
       * summarized survey footprints or simulation domains.
     * Output:

       * low dimensional feature vectors describing:

         * clustering amplitude,
         * correlation structure,
         * void and filament statistics,
           in each window.
   * Preconditions:

     * the underlying data or simulations must cover the window sufficiently to define these summaries.
3. ComponentName: `LSS_CounterfactualWorld_Template`

   * Type: experiment_pattern
   * Minimal interface:

     * Inputs:

       * model class specification,
       * finite library of prediction schemes,
       * encoding choices in `C_LSS`.
     * Output:

       * a pair of experiment setups corresponding to:

         * a low tension scenario,
         * a high tension scenario,
           with explicit window level predictions for `Tension_LSS`.
   * Preconditions:

     * the state space and constraints must be specified in a way that allows constructing mock datasets or model outputs for both scenarios.

### 8.2 Direct reuse targets

1. Q048 (BH_COSMO_H0_TENSION_L3_048: Cosmic expansion rate tension)

   * Reused component:

     * `LSS_TensionScore`, `LSS_CounterfactualWorld_Template`.
   * Why it transfers:

     * H0 tension involves comparing early and late universe inferences. Q045 consistency_tension encoding naturally extends to compare LSS inferred expansion histories with CMB inferred parameters.
   * What changes:

     * the focus shifts to windows and datasets most sensitive to H0 and growth rate parameters, but the functional form of `LSS_TensionScore` remains unchanged.
2. Q046 (BH_COSMO_BH_SEED_L3_046: Black hole seeding environments)

   * Reused component:

     * `CosmicWebField_Descriptor`.
   * Why it transfers:

     * black hole seeds form in specific cosmic web environments. Descriptors of halos, filaments, and voids from Q045 provide the environmental variables needed.
   * What changes:

     * outputs are used to parameterise seeding probability distributions instead of global LSS tension.
3. Q047 (BH_COSMO_SMBH_GROWTH_L3_047: Supermassive black hole growth histories)

   * Reused component:

     * `LSS_TensionScore`, `CosmicWebField_Descriptor`.
   * Why it transfers:

     * growth histories of supermassive black holes must be consistent with host halo growth and merger trees, which are constrained by LSS consistency. Tension scores help identify implausible combined growth scenarios.
   * What changes:

     * the focus is on joint consistency between structure formation and black hole populations, not just structure alone.
4. Q059 (BH_CS_INFO_THERMODYN_L3_059: Information and thermodynamics)

   * Reused component:

     * `LSS_TensionScore` as a template for measuring how much information about initial conditions is preserved in macroscopic patterns.
   * Why it transfers:

     * the idea of a scale windowed consistency_tension between micro level setup and macro level outcomes is shared between LSS and information thermodynamics.
   * What changes:

     * the underlying fields become state spaces and trajectories in information processing systems rather than cosmological density fields.

All transfers remain within the TU effective layer and do not imply shared microphysical mechanisms.

## 9. TU roadmap and verification levels

This block situates Q045 within the TU verification ladder and outlines next steps. All levels are defined at the effective layer.

### 9.1 Current levels

* E_level: E1

  * A coherent effective layer encoding of large scale structure formation as a consistency_tension problem has been specified.
  * The encoding:

    * uses finite window libraries and weight vectors fixed in advance,
    * defines a scalar tension functional `Tension_LSS(m)` within an admissible class `C_LSS`,
    * identifies a singular set and regular domain `M_LSS_reg`,
    * specifies falsifiable experiment patterns on real and mock data.
* N_level: N1

  * The narrative:

    * links early universe initial conditions,
    * structure growth,
    * and multiple data sources,
      through a single consistency_tension story.
  * Counterfactual worlds T and F have been defined in terms of the outcomes of `Tension_LSS(m)` under admissible encodings.

No claim is made that Q045 has reached higher verification levels at this stage.

### 9.2 Next measurable steps toward E2

To reach E2 for Q045, the following steps are proposed:

1. Construct a working prototype tool that:

   * implements at least one concrete encoding instance `E` in `C_LSS`,
   * ingests public cosmology parameter chains and LSS datasets,
   * computes `Tension_LSS(m_data)` and per window contributions,
   * publishes the resulting profiles and code as an open resource with clear documentation of:

     * window definitions,
     * weight vectors,
     * norms,
     * reference library,
     * thresholds such as `tau_global`, `tau_window`, and `f_min`.
2. Perform the real data experiment:

   * carry out a version of Experiment 1 with:

     * clearly documented window definitions,
     * an explicit choice of `tau_global`, `tau_window`, `f_min`,
     * publicly recorded choices of prediction schemes,
     * and a transparent list of tested parameter sets.
3. Publish a brief report:

   * describing whether the tested encodings achieve patterns close to World T, patterns closer to World F, or an intermediate situation,
   * and including enough detail for another group to reproduce the tension profiles.

These steps deepen the empirical grounding of Q045 while remaining within TU effective layer constraints.

### 9.3 Long term role in the TU program

In the longer term Q045 is intended to serve as:

* a main hub for:

  * cosmology related consistency_tension structures,
  * cross dataset consistency checks at large scales,
  * reference encodings for downstream cosmology nodes;
* a bridge between:

  * cosmology,
  * statistical physics,
  * information and thermodynamics,
    via shared patterns of scale dependent tension;
* a test bed:

  * for AI systems to practice structured reasoning about complex, multi dataset scientific questions,
  * without claiming proof level results about fundamental physics.

Q045 is not claimed as a solution to the large scale structure formation problem. Instead it is a structured container that makes the puzzle and its tension patterns explicit, testable at the level of encodings, and reusable across domains.

---

## 10. Elementary but precise explanation

This block explains Q045 in more accessible language while staying aligned with the effective layer description.

The visible universe today has a very rich pattern of structure. Galaxies live in clusters and filaments and leave behind huge voids. If we look backward in time, observations suggest that the universe started out much smoother, with only tiny ripples in density.

The basic cosmology story says:

* those tiny ripples were present in the early universe,
* gravity pulls a bit harder where the density is slightly higher,
* over billions of years those small differences grow,
* the result is the cosmic web of galaxies and voids we see today.

We have two big sets of information.

1. Early universe evidence:

   * the cosmic microwave background tells us about the tiny ripples and basic ingredients such as dark matter, baryons, and dark energy.
2. Late universe evidence:

   * galaxy surveys and weak lensing maps show us what the cosmic web looks like now across many scales and redshifts.

The usual expectation is that one set of physical laws and parameters should connect these two pictures. If we start from the early universe story and let the model run forward with those laws and parameters, we should get something like the observed cosmic web.

In the Tension Universe view we do not try to simulate everything inside this document. Instead we ask a simpler and more controlled question:

* Can we define a number that measures how well the early universe story and the late universe data fit together, when we look across many different scales and datasets at once.

To do this we:

1. Cut the data and predictions into a fixed set of scale and redshift windows chosen in advance.
2. Compare observed and predicted power spectra and correlation functions in each window.
3. Combine the mismatches into a single scalar called LSS tension for a given encoding instance.

If:

* there is at least one reasonable model within a chosen family and at least one encoding instance in `C_LSS` for which this LSS tension is small and stays stable as we refine our view in allowed ways,

then we say we live in a low tension large scale structure world for that combination.

If instead:

* for every reasonable model in that family and every encoding instance in `C_LSS`, the LSS tension stubbornly stays high in some windows and tends to get worse as we look more closely,

then we say that model family faces a high tension large scale structure world in the TU sense.

This does not tell us which cosmological model is true. It does something more modest and more precise:

* it encodes the question “Is this whole story self consistent across all our large scale structure data” as a number we can compute and test,
* it forces us to fix in advance which scales and windows we look at and how we combine them,
* it makes it clear when a model family fails, without having to build a full proof of any deep theory.

Q045 is therefore the node where:

* the story of how the cosmic web forms,
* the way we measure it,
* and the way we compare it to theory,

are all expressed as a single consistency_tension problem at the effective layer.

## Tension Universe effective layer footer

This page is part of the WFGY / Tension Universe S problem collection.

### Scope of claims

* The goal of this document is to specify an effective layer encoding of the problem “large scale structure formation” within the TU framework.
* It does not claim to prove or disprove the canonical statement in Section 1.
* It does not introduce any new theorem or physical law beyond what is already established in the cited literature.
* It should not be cited as evidence that the corresponding open problem in cosmology has been solved.

### Effective layer boundary

* All objects used here, including state spaces `M`, observables, invariants, mismatch functionals, tension scores, counterfactual worlds, and transfer components, live at the TU effective layer.
* The mapping from raw cosmology data or simulations to effective layer summaries is not specified here and may vary between implementations. Such mappings must still respect the constraints of the admissible encoding class `C_LSS`.
* No claim is made about the uniqueness or completeness of the encodings defined in this document. They are candidate encodings subject to falsification by the experiments in Section 6.
* Falsifying a TU encoding instance is not the same as falsifying a physical theory, and validating an encoding instance is not the same as confirming a theory.

This page should be read together with the following charters:

* [TU Effective Layer Charter](../Charters/TU_EFFECTIVE_LAYER_CHARTER.md)

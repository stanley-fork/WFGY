# Tension Universe (candidate) Overview

This page is the longer narrative and scope map for TU.
If you arrived from an external post, start here.

## What TU is (short, concrete)

Tension Universe (TU) is a candidate framework that treats reasoning as a structural field problem.
Instead of assuming more compute will always remove errors, TU asks:

- which failures persist even when compute increases
- whether an error floor is tied to structure, not scale
- how to keep explanations stable under reruns

TU is currently presented only at the Effective Layer.
Foundations are not disclosed in this stage.

## Why this exists (testing intent)

The goal is not to win debates.
The goal is to run pressure tests and keep records that can be rerun.

A good challenge is one that:
- pins down definitions
- stays reproducible
- forces clarity about scope and boundaries

If you want to challenge TU, please keep it structural and rerunnable.

## Public Challenge (MVP)

There is an ongoing open challenge process.
It exists to test whether Effective Layer explanations remain stable under independent reruns.

Key rules in plain form:
- challenges must be reproducible under the same version and definitions
- arbitration uses full reruns in a new chat window, preferably via share links
- screenshots or paraphrases do not count as evidence
- the official arbitration language is Chinese

For full rules, read the manifestos below.

## Response archives

All accepted challenge responses are stored here:

Each entry is recorded as a permanent reference.

## Scope boundaries (important)

TU is intentionally limited at this stage.

Public right now:
- Effective Layer language
- rerun friendly challenge records
- public archives

Not public right now:
- axioms
- internal construction rules
- full derivation paths
- implementation details

Requests to extract unreleased foundations may be refused.

## Safety boundary

Questions about weapons, illegal instructions, or harm will be declined.
They do not count as challenge wins.
